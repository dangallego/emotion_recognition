"I just spent $60 for the most disappointing BJ ever I’ve never thought of prostitutes before. But I’ve been so incredibly busy with life and work for the last two years or more, I haven’t dated anybody in that time or even gone out with anyone.

I’m not exactly flattering and I don’t quite have the time to go to night life to try my luck there.

I was just SO horny. So impulsively I pulled up to the area in my city known for having prostitutes going up and down the street looking for business. My goal was to pay for some cheap hole to stick into that was at least an actual vagina, bust, and leave.

I felt so awkward and didn’t even have the balls to tell her I wanted to fk her hole and leave and be done, I just went with “I don’t know yet”, got her into my car and went with the flow.

Uuuhh “the flow” ended up in me paying $20 for her to get some shit at a gas station, then pull up to some random apartment complex where we had to be so sneaky I couldn’t even TRY to enjoy it, and denied pussy for that very reason when I asked.

I settled for a BJ that I couldn’t even get hard for. And she charged me $40 for it.

Ultimately it’s okay, an overwhelmingly disappointing blowjob at a sketchy area of town with all the risk involved with no repercussions was well worth the $60 looking back. Could’ve been a lot worse, got the wrong person in my car, busted by cops, who knows.

Thanks for reading if you did, I just needed to get it out somewhere and there’s zero chance I’m telling this to a single soul ever.

**REFLECTION UPDATE**

Alright I thought about this for a while since I posted this and finally came up with how I wanted to word the answer I was looking for to all the people saying I dehumanized this woman by calling her a cheap hole.

I‘ll admit I am an asshole when it comes to wording, I don’t sugar coat bullshit and I called her a cheap hole cause that’s what she is. What do you rather I had called her? A bargain promiscuous lady? Lmfao. Like alright I can call her a cheap sex worker, but why bullshit? She a street hoe. I’m an asshole. That doesn’t mean I think less of her. I can simultaneously call people out for what they are while also respecting their choices - believe it or not in such a CRAZY concept. I treated her very nicely from start to end precisely cause I was respectful that she’s providing me a service. I stopped her mid sucking my limp dick cause I felt BAD for her for dealing with a soft guy for the last 10min and wanted to let her go her way. I would not be surprised if I was actually the person who treated her the nicest the entire night. And I didn’t treat her nicely as means to an end, I treated her nicely cause every human deserves to be treated well. Regardless of profession, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc. unless they specifically done something to you that warrants it.

But if you a bum I’ll call you a bum, if you’re a bitch I’ll call you a bitch, if you’re an asshole you’re an asshole, if you’re a hoe you’re a hoe. Why are some words okay and others not? You all called me asshole, shouldn’t you have respected me and called me an unpleasant guy? LOL no you called me for what I was.

I did not call her a cheap hole to dehumanize her or with the intention to disrespect her, however, that’s what Y’ALL assumed from the wording. You’re free to not believe me, and think because I used the word cheap hole there’s somehow no way I still believe she deserves to be treated well. I respect hoes, they’re just doing their thing, making their money. I treat them with respect and I’m always polite, but if you’re a hoe you’re a hoe and that’s okay.

I can both call you a hoe and still respect you as a human being, I’m just choosing not to use some more socially acceptable word in order to be presentable. On that end I am an asshole and I’ll admit to it. If you’re a hoe be a hoe, don’t be offended someone calls you a hoe - that’s what you are?? With that said I’m not gonna treat you as less of a person.

My sister is a stripper, she had only fans before and many partners. I’d tell her and people who’d ask to go out with her that she’s a hoe, why? Cause she was a hoe like tf? She never took offense to it cause it was the truth. I ain’t gonna call her prude cause she’s not. I simultaneously did not judge her choices one bit and would not let someone think less or disrespect my sister because she is a stripper and had an only fans. If calling someone an at best controversial word despite being what they actually are is highly offensive to you idc get off your snowflake island. I still respect them regardless, I just don’t act like a pussy and use more “acceptable terms” to convey it.

I think it’s real silly for any sex worker to get offended by being told how things are: she was a $40 BJ from the middle of the street. She was a street hoe. That doesn’t mean I treated her less than she deserved or called her that in my story to dehumanize her, it’s just how y’all perceived it. And deduced my entire personality as someone who doesn’t respect others. If your standards start with what word I choose to call someone, yeah you lost me there - definitely the asshole in that case. I won’t treat you anything but well though.

Check all my fkn replies. Did I call anyone any names? Curse anybody out? Acted disrespectful towards anyone? Tried to fight anyone wishing me terrible things? I did not. Matter fact I believe I held myself very reasonably this entire time. If I was a disgusting pig who doesn’t respect others, or women for that matter, how come I’m so polite to everyone who’s been judging me? Beats me bro.",confession,neutral,1758
"I lied about the pain during my colonoscopy to get more fentanyl During my pre-colonoscopy appointment I was told that the local anaesthesia I would be given fentanyl. And so knowing that this would probably be the only time to experience it I was honestly excited. To preface this was about a year ago and I hadn’t tried any other drug apart from weed and mushrooms at that point.

To preface I’ve always been curious about the feelings of different highs from different drugs. With all the negativity surrounding fentanyl I knew this would be the best time to experience it.

Fast forward to the beginning of my colonoscopy, I was to let them know if I was experiencing pain and a lot of discomfort. 

I get injected with my starting dose and they start the operation and whilst I still feel the effects of it - it wasn’t really a euphoric or energetic high, but a drowsy and blissful sort of one. So I’m laying there on the ‘hospital bed’ (idk) just watching the camera go through my insides and I just can’t help but wonder if I could get some more because I wasn’t really feeling any euphoria. 

I then begin to make fake grunting sounds as if I’m in pain and one of the nurses holds my hand and tells me to squeeze if I’m in pain. I squeeze and they then give me some more. As they’re injecting me with it they tell me that this is the most they’re giving me (which was a lie for some reason, I’ll go into that later). I start feeling like I’m being absorbed into the bed. 

Some time goes by (no clue how much) and the same thought pops up again - “I wonder what more feels like. It’s not like I’m gonna die of an overdose surrounded by all of these doctors right?

More grunting and moaning sounds later I’m being injected with more despite being told that the previous dose was the last one (I may be misremembering and that this was when I was told it was the last dose but I’m almost certain they told me that twice including this time).

I’m feeling super light now and feel like I could just look at the wall forever laying there on that bed. That’s all I really remember up to that point. I barely remember the end of the colonoscopy and don’t remember being wheeled into another room after it ended. 

I do however remember, after being wheeled into another room, listening to some type of calming instrumental music on my phone. A doctor walked in to check my vitals and he asked what I was listening to and I said rock music for some reason (I don’t even listen to rock or anything like it). He then asked who my favourite rock band was or something like that and I replied Michael Jackson not even in a joking manner or anything idk wtf possessed me to even say rock or Michael Jackson. He then just left the room I don’t really remember his reaction, he didn’t really have any to my recollection. 

But that was about it, I was in that room for a couple more hours until I was picked up by my mom to be taken home or I would’ve had to have been there for 24 hours.",confession,neutral,278
"Got a massage in another country but didn’t end up how I planned. Throwaway because my wife views my main account. 

I went to the Philippines for a work trip and when checking into the hotel the front desk asked if I wanted a massage charged to the room. She said it would be $18USD for 1 hour. That was a no brainer for me so I told her let’s do it. Called to talk to my wife and told her about it and she joked “don’t be getting no happy endings”, which I laughed because I honestly had never thought of that. 

The massage person ended up coming to my room and I took off my clothes and laid on the bed and she covered my butt with a small towel. She began the massage and I slowly was drifting into a purely relaxed mode. It must have been about 20-30 min but I heard her tell me to turn over, which I did. She covered my penis area with the towel and proceeded to massage my feet and legs. I’m not sure what got me but when she would rub my leg, the top of her hand would slightly brush against my penis. It was nothing for a bit but all of the sudden I began to become harder and harder to which she noticed and chuckled. She moved down towards my ankle and calf but I  could not get my erection to calm down. The towel then fell off my penis because of the erection and I didn’t know what to do, and all of the sudden I felt this massive buildup in me and realized I was about to cum. I froze with fear and she kept rubbing my calf’s and then all of the sudden I just exploded, right there in front of her. She looked very surprised and I was super embarrassed. She cleaned me up and the massage came to an end about 10 min later. I apologized to her and gave her a decent tip and was hoping I would never see her again. 

I talked to my wife that next day and she asked how it went and I told her it went great and nothing else. I felt so incredibly bad that I had lied to her and not told her about it. I’m not sure if I was in the wrong but it sure felt like it so I kept quiet. This has been eating me up for years and I just want to find a way to tell her.",confession,neutral,3821
"I’m pretty sure I once mistakenly had a sugar mama. I went into the 2020 pandemic during the biggest breakup of my life. (At that point). 

Soon enough, Nicole came along. 

She requested to follow me late one night on IG, so I shot my shot. 

Before I knew it, we were on the phone, talking, exchanging secrets, etc. 

TikTok was pretty big back then considering people were trapped in their houses.

I saw a video that day claiming that women fantasize about sex 43 times a day on average. 

I decide to bring it up. Before you know it, I spun a lie to make her horny enough to start rubbing with me on the phone. 

(I have a sexy voice and active imagination). 

We were pretty serious for a day and a half or so, then I realized it couldn’t really go anywhere cause we came from very different backgrounds. 

Eventually, she became a very good friend. 

She’d send me money regularly, buy me food, and most importantly was there for me when I needed. (I returned the favor). 

Eventually when I was aware of her sexuality, I’d literally FaceTime her, pull my dick out, she’d sarcastically roll her eyes, put on a show for me, let me finish, and we’d hang up. 

She even sent me birthday money once.

Eventually she got really involved with her boyfriend, so she disappeared for a few months. 

Someone close to her let me know that after it ended, she’d been looking to talk to me. 

I find out that one night while we were having phone sex, her boyfriend was sleeping on another phone in the background. (Very funny, but suckish for the guy). 

Then she eventually found someone new who I encouraged her to go after. Pretty sure they’re married. 

I miss her doe.

"I can't forgive myself for what I did in 7th grade. In 7th grade, I was that guy who had 2 close friends(we were a trio). I used to talk to my classmates sometimes about random stuff but never made any friends. Me and my friends always used to sit together, we used to talk and laugh during lectures, but we never caused trouble for others. One day, the teacher separated the entire trio. I was made to sit next to a girl. She was nice to me. I let her copy notes sometimes. She helped me out too. I think we became friends then, we used to talk about movies, music, etc. Then other students started teasing me and her. They used to call us lovers and all. At first, I didn't bother. But then, things started getting out of hand. They wouldn't stop. They used to call me by her name when I passed by. I was really bothered by it. I tried to stop them. Even my friends stepped in to help, but it was of no use. One guy even wrote our name in heart on a bench with a marker. Then I completely stopped talking to her. I didn't want to be teased by others. She noticed the change and came and tried to talk about it. I just told her to leave me alone. She didn't have any friends. She was all alone. She had lost her mother, just 2 months before this happened. One could see that she was disturbed by that. She didn't express it much, but one could tell she was hurt because of how I pushed her away like that. Soon, she changed the school. My friends later told me, what I did was wrong. I regretted it. I am now a First Year college student. I recently saw her while I was on my way to college. I do not know if she saw me, or if she even remembers me. But, I very well remember her and am ashamed of my previous actions. I wanted to go up to her and talk to her and wanted to apologize but I couldn't. I just stood there watching her leave.",confession,neutral,181
"I chewed on my foot shavings because it had a nice texture Sorry. This is a bit of a nasty confession I can't admit to anyone in real life. I have a habit of chewing on things because I like the texture. I've chewed on the soft parts of my fingers, beauty blender sponges and straws because it just feels so good to keep chewing.

One time, I was grooming myself and cutting my toenails. I noticed that I had a lot of dead skin on the sole of my foot, and decided to try cutting it off with a penknife since I'd done similar things to my calluses before. So I did, and I cut a really big thick round piece out (think 3mm thickness, 5cm diameter). It was the first time I had ever handled such a huge piece of thick skin, and I was really intrigued that this piece of thing was produced by my own body.

Handling it just made me more curious because it had this firm but malleable texture that reminded me a bit of beef jerky. Then, the thought popped into my head: what would it feel like if I chewed it? So I did just that. 

I was right - it was chewy in an addictive way. There was just this resistance about the skin that made it so fun to keep chewing, so I just kept chewing on it lol.

No I didn't eat the skin, but I would probably chew on it again if I had more tbh.",confession,neutral,1071

"I’m a terrible person and I just need to get this off my chest This is a reupload, but of my own story. I just kind of need some advice, harsh or nice, I am not the victim of the story and I am well aware that I’ve made a mistake that isn’t okay.

I’m a reptile owner of many, I’ve literally never rehomed any of my reptiles and have always rescued my reptiles from neglectful situations. I’ve always fed them, housed them, and ensured what time I had with them was pleasant.

Recently I’ve been noticing I wasn’t cut out for one of my rescues. I rescued him from someone else literally off of facebook marketplace, [I felt so bad for him,] and tried to give him a good life. He was an extremely flighty gecko, a look don’t touch. I couldn’t clean his cage or even put food within his cage bc of how flighty he was, and it made keeping him healthy and his space clean hard. Extremely difficult. And that’s not his fault at all. He had a spacious enclosure with lots of hiding spots to keep cover from the naked eye, which I thought would alleviate his stress. But regardless it didn’t, and I’m sure that’s due to his previous owner/s. 

Recently we’ve been having some wonderfully hot weather so I made an irrational decision to let him loose. No one wanted him when I tried to humanely rehome him and it was growing bad for him and I. He genuinely seemed so much more relieved once out of his enclosure in my yard.

But now he stays in this one tree outside my house. Literally, I go check on him every day. He seems to be doing well, still flighty and does not want to be touched or caught. He’s bright colors, often like I’d see when he was relaxed hanging out in his enclosure, or when he was enjoying high temps. 

Idk. I know this isn’t humane and I’d NEVER make this choice again..it’s so cruel and I hate myself for it, but at the same time he is genuinely thriving without living in that enclosure, and I see him daily even though people don’t know about it.

I just wanted to confess this to someone else to read lol. I haven’t told anyone. I feel horrid. I would never make this choice again even with the hardest reptile. I just thought it was the best choice, and idk what I was thinking. I miss him a lot. He’s not dead, and is doing well where he is, but I still feel immense dread and guilt.

I’m reuploading this merely because I just want people to read it, share an experience, share advice, whatever it provokes other people to do. Because it’s genuinely bothering me that I made this choice but I felt it was for the better. He seems so much happier and I just feel guilt because it’s traditionally extremely inhumane to do this.",confession,neutral,90
"I was touched multiple times by multiple different male male family members. Uh this is my first ever post and I just feel like I need to get this off my chest. I will not be mentioning how old I am or any personal details about me as ik my family members use Reddit a lot to read AITA or the confessions. I was first touched at the age of 3 or 4 by my dad, It made me a very sexual child. Id fantasies about being an adult with a curvy body and I'd masturbate quite a bit. Back then I didn't understand what I was doing wrong because yes I would get caught. I would get in so much trouble but for some reason I couldn't help myself. I would wait until I was alone or when everyone was asleep. Well I vividly remember one night I was trying to sleep and I couldn't so I decided to touch myself. And as I was I saw my dad walk down the hallway, so I tried to pretend I was asleep so he wouldn't yell at me to go to sleep, well he ended up coming into my room and rubbing my body and my butt while. I asked him what he was doing (bare in mind I was like 3-5) he told me to shut up and then asked what I was doing, and why was I still awake. I told him I don't know and that's when he rubed inbetween my legs. I squirmed and then he left. I went to sleep maybe an hour later just to wake up again in a different bed with my pants down later in the night. He would leave and then come back to touch me. I remember crying almost every night knowing he was touching me there and I was too scared to tell anyone because he was also very mean to me. He would tell at me constantly. He would hit me. He would bully me all the time and then at night would touch me while I was asleep while my mother slept in the room next door. One day my mother said that we were moving and me and my siblings where all excited. I thought finally maybe I can get away from him and be okay. But when we moved it happened more. And two other family members on his side touched me as well. My older cousin made me lay on top of him while he grinded against my private parts while my younger cousin slept right next to us. And my uncle put his hand down my pants and touched me while sitting right next to my aunty (his wife, my dads sister). At this point I knew it wasn't right. But it wasn't until sex ed in grade 6-7 where I learnt what SA was. That's when I knew it was wrong. What they were doing was molestering me from a young age, yet still I was afraid to say anything so I kept quiet. I would smile and be happy while silently crying on the inside. this continued for years, my dad touching me more often my cousin and uncle only did it once from what I remember. But my dad continued to touch me for years after. It didn't stop till I was 14 or 15. I was in my room trying to sleep and that's when  he came in and tried to bribe me with my phone (mune and my siblings phones got taken off of us) saying ""I will give this back to you if you do me a favour. It will only take five minutes"" I knew what he wanted but I tried to play it off saying back ""what is it? A job? Like cleaning?"" He wouldn't tell me what if was and just kept saying that it would be quick and only take five minutes. He then tried to get on my bed and touch me but I jumped off and said ""no I know what you want and I don't want to. Stop"" and I walked into the lounge, all the lights were still on and my sister was watching tv on the couch. I pretended that everything was fine and sat next to her. He got very mad with me the look in his eyes where as if I had stabbed him almost like a ""how dare you"" and he took it out on me the next day making me do loads of chores and yelling at me. My mother yelled at me a lot that day too.

Very sorry this is long. There is so many more incidents that I could definitely talk about but I feel this is so long already. I'm very sorry again and I understand if no one reads this I just really needed to get it off my chest. 

Edit: I only posted this a few minutes ago and already so many have given some kind words and advice. Thank you sm I will respond as much as I can. Also forgive me on the grammar. And spelling mistakes english isn't my first language I translated most of it through chat gpt and google.

Edit #2: hello guys, thank you so much for your kind words and advice. However I keep debating whether I should have posted or not as I am getting very questionable DMS. I've just had a person say ""so you think your dad was right for touching you?"" I replied with ""no why are you asking"" to which they responded ""he must have felt strong urges to do that"". I asked why they were messaging those things and I got no reply I infact think they blocked me. I wish I could put in a screenshot but I don't know how. I'm sorry if my story had made people upset or mad. But this is my truth and I would appreciate it if I didn't get those sorts of messages. Thank you 

Edit#3: hey guys so a lot of you have been telling me to tell someone and I should have mentioned that I did tell one person. They were my closest person and I would talk to them about everything. They unfortunately moved far away when I was still little and they cut off the whole family I never knew why. I would try to reach out but it's like they fell off the earth. I miss them dearly and hope they are doing well but I still feel hurt sometimes as they haven't reached out after years. Thank you for the ongoing support ❤️‍🩹",confession,neutral,370

"I lost my best friend and I don’t know how to make things right Warnings: mentions alcohol use, suicide, abuse

I lost my best friend and I don’t know how to make things right 

I (27F) had a friend from middle school through the first year of college - I’ll call her Shayla. 

Shayla was a rock for me during a difficult period of bullying in middle school and part of high school. At the end of high school into college my anxiety and insecurity was getting bad. 

Freshman year of college I noticed Shayla started pulling away and our friendship changed. She got her first serious boyfriend who happened to live in the same dormitory on the same floor as I did, and she would come and go a lot without us seeing each other. She started going to a lot of social events with mutual friends that other close friends were included in, but I was excluded from. She started prioritizing some newer friendships, some with people that made me uncomfortable and openly made fun of me during gatherings. I started to cling to other circles of college friends and ignore it as best I could. I wanted to talk about it with her but didn't know how. 

Towards the end of that first year of college Shayla’s partner’s roommate, someone all of us in both circles knew very well since they lived in that same floor, ended up taking his own life. It was a terrible time, and it somehow created a weirder rift. I barely spoke to her the rest of that year. 

The second year of college my anxiety was very bad and I started freaking out over little things that happened, and lashing out in small ways. 

Examples: Shayla unadded me on Snapchat, so I unadded her on Twitter. She'd post about a gathering with people from the first year that I didn't even know about, so I'd make a post about doing something with different friends. 

One day I was walking to a meeting for a student group I was in. I passed her while she was walking with another friend, and neither of us said anything at all or even acknowledged each other. I was anxious about it and the same night I texted her asking to hang out, and she said she couldn't that weekend, but would take a rain check. I ruminated on it intensely, to the point where I felt physically sick, and then that same day I went nuclear. I just blocked her number completely. I also deleted my social media because I was tired of seeing everything happening around me while I was sat up alone in a dorm most days. 

In the next few months there was a social event both Shayla and I were invited to, and attended. We said nothing to each other. To make it worse a few of the people there were ones who had talked crap about me and bullied me during those earlier school days. Some friends later asked after that interaction why I didn't talk to her anymore, and I lied and said it was because she was talking crap about me. I didn't actually know that to be the case. I was so anxious about how quickly our friendship deteriorated, and how much I was shut out by her and the friends from that first year, that I didn't know how to explain what had happened. 

One day towards the end of that second year of college Shayla actually emailed me asking if I wanted to hang out with her and and another mutual friend. I was really happy to hear from her, especially after such a difficult year, and I emailed back apologizing that my phone ""wasn't working"" (remember, I had blocked her) and saying I'd love to, asking about where and when. I never heard back. At that point I was distraught and feeling very alone so I went nuclear again and deleted her number. 

Fast forward to the last year of school - I had reached a point where I had tried anything and everything to cope with my anxiety (except what I actually needed which was therapy, and maybe medication). I ended up using alcohol a lot and it led to a bad cycle of not taking care of myself, shutting people out, and overthinking absolutely everything - and of course it also made the anxiety worse. 

I was drunk at a party one night and ended up ranting to someone at the party. I didn't remember most things from that night but came to find out later that I had ranted about Shayla, and said she was talking crap about me and had said something bad about a different friend - we ll call her Andrea. That wasn't completely untrue; Shayla and I both gossiped with each other in high school and would say stuff to each other about other people like Andrea, who she had said some things about. But I shouldn't have said it at the party regardless.  Shayla and the Andrea weren't close and hadn't seen each other in a few years, but to this day I feel bad about causing a rift between them of any sort. Andrea asked me about it later that last year of college a few months after the party and I didn't correct it - I just reinforced the sort-of-lie, which I feel made it worse.

Then came the end of college - shortly after graduation Shayla emailed me saying she felt bad we grew apart, asking if I wanted to meet up. I sent an email back apologizing for any hurt I caused since I had no idea if she had tried to reach out over phone, and that I was glad to hear from her. We met up and talked. She asked about me thinking she was gossiping about me. I apologized and was straightforward that being shut out by her and the group she was with was what made me paranoid that she was talking crap, but that I hadn't heard anything specific. She asked me if it had anything to do with her saying something about the Andrea and I said no. While that was true, that me ghosting her had nothing to do with something she said about Andrea, I didn't come clean about having said that at the party (I assume the person I was talking to at the party circulated it to where it got back to her). 

We talked more about what had gone on in those few years - both of us had some difficult romantic relationships, covid had happened, etc - and then we parted ways. I know we won’t be friends again and I feel I’ve done everything I can to bring closure with her personally, but I wish I had handled things so differently and just talked to her early on about how I was feeling. 

The thing I feel that I really left unresolved is telling Andrea that I had said Shayla was talking crap because I was hurt, and not because she actually was. I don't know how to come clean to the Andrea because it isn’t black and white, but I feel it was lie and I don’t know if/how it’s affecting their rift or the opinions of others in our general social circle. 

Andrea is also someone who has not historically been the most trustworthy friend for me which comolicates things. 

Long Example: I had a horrible romantic relationship experience my last year of college involving abuse that I don’t want to get into the details of, and which caused me to seek therapy for the first time (which I guess is a silver lining). That “partner” (if you can call him that) ended up going around to anyone that would listen asking them what I had said about him (I’d said nothing, I wanted to pretend nothing had happened and move on with my life) and then saying very horrible things about me. Andrea told me he’d said horrible things but wouldn’t specify what they were, then later in the year she invited me to go out with her so she could bring another friend, we ll call her Tina, in the hopes I would go on my own rant about the relationship (which I didn’t do). I know this because the same day Andrea invited me out I got a long text from the former “partner”, after months of no contact, saying he wanted to know how I was doing, and had been thinking of me. I didn’t respond. I also knew because Shayla and Tina spent that outing asking by me vague questions about how I’d been doing, who I’d heard from recently, and looked visibly disappointed when the outing ended with me having said nothing about what happened. 


Today I have healthier friendships with people I met at a better time in my life and a new romantic partner that I love, and that has stuck with my through intense anxiety which makes me hopeful that I can have healthy, long lasting relationships in general. I’ve done counseling a couple times and recently set up my first psychiatry appointment to find a more permanent solution for anxiety, overthinking, self esteem, and general emotional struggles. I have been very intentional about not gossiping, being more responsive to friends, and proactively reaching out to people - even when it’s awkward and something is bothering me. Shayla has a romantic partner and is engaged, and from what I can tell seems to be doing well which I’m very glad about.

Is digging this back up and clearing the air with Andrea is the right thing to do - and if it is, how to approach it? I don’t want her and Shayla’s rift to impact their well being, or their social circle around them, regardless of whether or not they were close. Part of me feels it would be good to come clean about why I said what I said at that party, the other doesn’t trust Andrea and doesn’t know if I’d just be opening an old wound. 

What do you think I should do? Any advice is helpful. Sorry for the length and appreciate anyone who can weigh in.",confession,neutral,9
"I’ve been avoiding my friends for months and I don’t know how to fix it I’ve been avoiding my friends for months now, and I feel guilty about it. It started out small, like missing a hangout here and there, but over time it’s become a habit. I tell myself it’s because I’m busy or just need time alone, but the truth is, I don’t know how to tell them that I just don’t feel like being around people right now.

I’ve been pushing them away slowly, and now it feels like there’s this huge distance between us that I can’t undo. I feel bad because I know they care, but I don’t want to lie to them either.

"Me and my motorcycle blasted into a jaywalker at 55mph. I was driving 55mph on a highway with a whole line of cars about 50 yards behind me.  The road was dark and out of nowhere, this dude is stumbling in the middle of the road and I only had a microsecond to swerve without wiping out.

My handlebar caught his arm and Im 100% sure he went down to the ground.

"I am a pervert and I try to hide it from everyone who knows me. I am really young, I admit it. Since I entered pre-adolescence, those subtle tastes or strange signals from childhood became a dark part of my personality. It was obvious from the moment I thought ""Nobody should know this about me"" and reluctantly erased those twisted thoughts from my mind. I have always felt a great fascination with master-pet relationships, cannibalism, some topics related to the feederism community, vampirism, a small obsession with control in ways as twisted as you can imagine. In my mind, it is really attractive to maintain control and a certain sense of ownership over someone, to the point of perhaps depriving that person of their physical freedom (you know what I mean and it's not pretty) and keeping them by my side as if they were an animal with no voice or vote in my decisions. It's one of the reasons why it's too difficult for me to form deep bonds or genuine connections; it's understandable, even I know how creepy it can be. I know perfectly well that I am sane; social interactions are simple and I can keep my desires perfectly isolated for as long as necessary. They don't harm my friendly or family relationships, as I would never let anyone find out about my twisted tastes. Deep down, I know I'm someone lacking human values with which I can identify, but that doesn't mean I don't want a conventional relationship like that of a happy couple. Unfortunately, I have always rejected people who fall in love with me because I know how terrifying it could be to confess to my special person how much I like to drink my own blood or show them all my sadomasochistic fantasies. I wouldn't want them to stop seeing me as ""the intelligent boy in class, the responsible brother, the pretty boy without a sense of humor"" to start seeing me as the next Jeffrey Dahmer. I can form genuine affection connections that exclude a part of my essence, but I know they will never fully satisfy me and that makes me somewhat sad... Very sad. I would never do anything to harm someone, but if I had the opportunity to make my most disgusting desires reality, I still wouldn't do it; nobody should suffer because of the sick mind of a boy who received a late sexual education. I would like to meet someone with whom to share that part of me that I keep silenced daily, someone who instead of judging it takes the time to understand it and in a way, enjoy it (no, I don't mean committing bloody acts; a simulation perhaps, nothing that involves causing real harm), but I understand that most people don't find it pleasant to have a human pet and I know I'll be perfectly fine without a double life in which I become a serial killer to satisfy my emotional voids of disgusting things. And by sharing I don't mean anything explicit through images or anything sick, I'm talking about metaphors, writings, stories, and personal experiences. I love drinking my own blood, but I wouldn't tolerate explicit visual content of that action. I don't like seeing people harm themselves; as much as a certain part of me feels strangely good, my sane side never lets me frequent such content or promote it. I'm not justifying the fact that yes, my tastes are disgusting, I don't recommend them as a healthy or wholesome practice and I am someone who genuinely enjoys these things because I probably have some kind of trauma that I'm unaware of, so I don't romanticize the actual practice of such acts and I take full responsibility for all my actions, none directed with the purpose of harming someone else, only myself to a slight extent. I've preferred to live pretending that I'm aroace rather than facing my own reality and that doesn't make me happy, but I think it's the right thing to do.

"I’ve been “playing” guitar for over thirty years.  All my friends know me as the guitar guy. I have thousands of dollars worth of gear.  I know all kinds of music theory. I can’t play guitar. This isn’t my main account so I can hide my shame from my friends. I’ve had guitars hanging on my wall since I was 15 years old. I own four acoustic and six electric guitars, plus a ton of pedals amps, etc.  

I give out guitar playing advice on forums, but it’s just stuff I’ve read or I google the problem and give the AI answer. I’d much rather sit and watch guitar tutorials or music theory videos than actually practice.  

I know what scales are but I don’t know any.  I know what modes and triads are but I don’t know any.  I can play maybe three chords, but not well.  I like the feeling of making music on the guitar but I also hate practicing.  

At this point, it’s part of my identity and everyone assumes I’m accomplished when they find out how long I’ve been “playing”.   I always come up with some excuse on the rare occasion that someone asks me to play something.  I’m terrified for anyone to hear me play because my secret will be revealed, instantly.  

I’m in my late forties, and I’m fully aware that the fantasy of being famous and playing on the stage for thousands of people is far behind me.  If I ever did become proficient, it would just be for my own gratification. 

I do this with all my hobbies.  I spend a bunch of money, get lots of gear and never do anything with it.  I own four sets of juggling balls and can’t juggle.  I own a weaving set and have never completed a project. I’ve been trying to learn Spanish but don’t remember any of the vocab. I don’t know what’s broken in my brain; I’m fairly intelligent and have a tech savvy job.  I should be able to learn these things.  

 I know the obvious advice is to try another instrument or give it up. However, I really do like the idea of playing guitar and I’m not willing to give the hobby up.  Removing this part of my identity would feel like killing part of who I am. Maybe today will be the day I start practicing, but I doubt it.  

Anyway, I’m a fake and a liar and I just wanted to get that off my chest.

"Desicion that changed my entire life and it's perspective Hi guys, today I want to share about the desicion that took in my life which changes my life the way I think I way I thought everything. This is not a forceful decison or an influential. It's all on me only. The decision is I want to get married to my love of my life.

Here's the story in 2017 during inter I went to my frnd home she invited me as there was a pooja I went there everything is well until there's a guy of her relative came there and just had a look we had then after lunch I came back to home all is well. But suddenly the very next day that guy came near to my home I got shocked 😳 my family and me are going to another function to some other place then at the afternoon I got a call from an unknown number I lifted that call nd shockly this is him who I saw in the morning. Then we talked how you got the number. Later we spoke at the very fast meeting he told me to get married.

 I was shocked we have age gap nearly 7 yrs. I told no let's just be friends and then will see. After that I didn't talk to much because I am busy with my studies. Later I had an another meeting with him in my frnds home. He is too fast to touch and want to take the things fast. I told I am not that much interested.then  I left the place after some time. Then we start talking to each other . Then met with an accident. I prayed alot to the god to get good health because I am having an positive thoughts on him. 

He recovered and he can't able to lift his hand bcz hand got facture. Later we talked and small small meeting we got I thought things are good on going I shared at first only that I am bit angry person and he told me that yes I will handle you. 

But things got changed on new year 2019 I waited a long tym to talk but he is busy in some other call.till morng 3 am I am in waiting only. Early he called and talk like nothing happened I got broke I cried alot I injured my arm also still he is not reacted like I did a mistake. Then after he didn't even say sorry for his mistake instead he portrayed like my behaviour is the reason.

"Uber pool done right in Gurgaon, back in January 2017!! This was in Gurgaon, near Galleria market and I used to stay in a posch society behind it. I had casually booked a ride not thinking much. 

When the cab arrived, I saw a hot af girl just browsing her phone, sitting in the back seat. I scooted inside and casually said hi. She responded with a nonchalant hey and we got chatting. She seemed cool and had decent conversational skills, esp after being that hot.

I played it cool, didn't try to put in too much effort. When she started asking questions about my work and lifestyle, I knew she was interested. I asked what her plans were and she said she was gonna go to the mall. I asked her about LinkedIn and connected. I had a premium membership and her phone number was public. 

A few seconds later, she gets a text on her phone telling her about where she was and where she was headed. While she was spooked, I as her co-passenger kept talking with her coolly. I asked if there was something bothering her and she relented quickly. I consoled her and told her to block the guy, but she didn't ;)

When she was getting out of the cab, I admitted it was me on the other side and I was just pranking her. She was a little angry but definitely impressed. I told her that since I already had her number, it was customary to ask her out for a date. She hesitantly agreed and I asked her if she wanted to go out then and there.

"I let my hands wander on a friend who wasn't into it :/. CW// mention of non-consensual touch, substance use, and possible addiction.

-

I feel really sick to my stomach thinking about it, so I guess that's a good thing.

At a group sleepover (20F), we all got high and drunk in the same night, which honestly should've been reason enough for me to stop. Especially as the group's hard-weight while my friends are more light-weights. Before we went to bed, I laid down on a friend's (20F) leg and asked them to play with my hair. Their hands began to get more aggressive and my hand reflex squeezed their thigh, the pressure only increased so with my delusion, I assumed they liked it. That plus asking them if they felt comfortable and the one of the responses back being a wink, I thought I was in the clear. In fact, I assumed I was encouraged.

So not long after, I let my hand wander to their upper thigh, their stomach, and their chest, all while people were trying to sleep around us too. After touching/brushing those areas, I couldn't get another answer if they were comfortable or not and if I could continue touching there; so I stopped but they stopped being comfortable quite a while prior. 

*They messaged me last night and I don't think they weren't into it at all. I doubt a single part of it. I went on for so long. Though some responses might've been misleading in my eyes, I could never get a flat out yes from them and now I know exactly why. I shouldn't have touched them without a flat out yes, but I was too caught up in my own emotions to care about that. I was selfish and didn't fully consider if they weren't into it the way I was. Dumb note, but I'm also a virgin, the most virgin in the group, so maybe I was just that desperate or clueless to stoop that low for any action.

I feel so disgusted with myself to have made them uncomfortable. Honestly, I'm wondering if I'm having a sex/masturbation and weed addiction that's feeding into all this, and I accidentally took it out on them? I had to apologize while a bit high (**got high not expecting the message a few hours later) and I'm worried I sounded fake as hell because of it. Sometimes the only motivation I have day to day are those two things. It's not an excuse but it might be a reason and I feel gross knowing that. I feel gross even wanting to get off after this.

They're in my main friend group I've had since High School. I don't know why I decided to risk this, I just wish I never did. Especially as someone who's also been uncomfortable being touched by somebody. Yes is yes, no is anything else.

-

Edit:

Thank you for the genuine replies, just wanted to confirm that I've already apologized to this friend. 

In the morning, I asked maybe once or twice if I made them uncomfortable and they said no, but that was to brush it off. After they left, I messaged them and asked if they were uncomfortable and I'd never do it again if they were, and they said they didn't care too much of it and it's a one time thing we can sweep under the rug. A few nights pass until they confronted me last night. That they never gave explicit consent for me to start nor continue, how close my hands got, and the nerve I had doing this in front of our friends. I sent quite a few messages apologizing back, absolutely on their side, and that I feel remorseful. It's currently left on delivered. I just hope they don't feel unsafe around me, though it's very fair if they do.

*added another line for clarification that me and my friend have already addressed this.

**clarification that I didn't get high to apologize to them! i immediately stopped puffing once they opened the convo and I didn't continue smoking until hours after the conversation was over. I wanted to be as sober as I could be for the conversation.

+note: other times I asked them for their comfortability, it was often left unanswered, instead stating how intoxicated they were. I should've stopped there. I only let my hands roam further than the outer leg after the wink as that was my most clear answer, which still isn't a full yes. + I asked about the wink afterwards, they said they couldn't remember answering like that.",confession,neutral,727

I went to my gp and she put me on citalopram. However I had exams coming up and I couldn’t really wait 6 weeks for the citalopram to kick in so I started doing cöcaine. I had done it once before at a party and it made me so happy so I did it again. 

I remember that day so specifically. I was no longer tired and my body didn’t feel like a million bricks. The voice in my head that kept telling me to go kill myself for the past 11 years if my life disappeared. I never felt better. And so I started doing it everyday. I went from lying in my bed for 4 days straight to spending 10 hours at the library studying. Anyway I learnt a whole years worth of stuff in about 3 weeks. Id do cocaine everyday about 5 times (a little line each time) And I passed my exams! And when I went back to my home country for the summer for 3 months I was sober. 

It wasn’t too bad being sober. Because now that I knew what not being depressed was like even when I sometimes felt suicidal I kept telling myself that life isn’t that bad. For my second year of uni when I came back I found it impossible for me to study. And with the winter coming I found myself barely able to get out of bed and suicidal again. So what do I do? Cocaine. And again it fixed my life. I got my shit together started going to class and studying. Ofc I don’t have all the money in the world. So I’d pace myself. 3gs every month. So if I had little left and a week left till my next re up I’d save it or not do some for few days. Id ration my coke for the month. 

And yeh. That was like 2 years ago. I still do coke everyday. I do other drugs too Ofc but recreationally. All bc of coke I am now a star student. All my professors love me. People come to for help with their assignments. All my grades are A’s. I’ve learnt so much and I am a very scholarly person now all thanks to coke. Ofc doing coke everyday is no way to be. It’s expensive, its bed for my heart etc. but I don’t know how else to be. 

I am very close with my parents and they’re super strict Muslims. So strict that they don’t believe in psychological medication. When I was 16 and I started taking sertraline my mom and my dad both called me a drug addict (haha foreshadowing) and when they learnt that it didn’t work they told me that I wasted their money and that everything going on is in my head. And they forbade me from taking any kind of other medication. Ofc when I turned 18 I went to my gp (I live in the U.K.) and she prescribed me bunch of stuff but nothing worked on my brain. I kind of resent my parents. Because they don’t realise £200 missing from my bank account every month but they’d get so mad if they found out I talked to a therapist or took any medication. So in a way they made me an addict. 

I feel so ambivalent. I know coke is bad but I don’t know what else to do. No psychological medicine is allowed because of my parents and even if they did allow if I’ve tried so much shit I don’t think anything will work. But I don’t know what else to do. I’m sober if I’m not studying or doing uni work. But there’s still 2 years more to my degree. I’m conflicted. 

EDIT- Ik some people will say I’m justifying my addiction bc of my parents. But they are a huge reason why I’m doing coke. If I was on anti depressant, I can’t stop overnight and go on holiday with them. I’ll have withdrawal and start throwing up. With coke I just hide the coke in the house and go on holiday feel perfectly fine. 

Also regarding adhd, a private diagnoses is £4000 and I am financially reliant on my parents and they would never pay that much for a adhd diagnoses. They don’t realise £100 missing every month tho. My parents also check my phone and messages. I can hide one text to my dealer every month from my parents. I can’t hide multiple calls and emails and texts from psychiatrists or doctors or people calling to confirm an appointment. And if you say don’t give them your phone. If I don’t they psychically hold me down and take my phone away from me and check my phone, messages, pictures, everything. So yeh. Idk what to do. And I can’t draw a boundary between them bc like I said they’ll just take my phone away as soon as I try to set boundaries.",confession,neutral,152

I need s\*x to breathe.   
Not just any s\*x though and not with just anyone. 

I am quite specific about my wants/needs, my likes/dislikes. I am quite dominant in my everyday life and find myself on the side of ultimate submission when it comes to s\*x. 

I crave dominance from a tall, foreign, accent yielding, salt and pepper haired man.

"Decades ago I stole a lost purse at work. I’ve never told anyone until today. Many years ago I worked at a grocery store during college. I was constantly broke and didn’t know if I could afford my books in the coming semester.

One day, a customer turned in a small, lost purse. I brought it back to our office and glanced in it to see if I could find the person‘s identity. I found their license, but also there was over $300 in cash. In a moment of greed and desperation that was in no way justifiable, I crammed the purse into my pocket and ran it out to my car. It had an ID, and credit cards, and other things, but I just wanted that cash to cover some of my upcoming bills, including my books.

The next day the customer came back to see if anyone had found her purse. She was probably in her 60s or 70s. One of my coworkers told her no, there was nothing in the lost and found. The woman looked so overwhelmed. This was long before modern phones and connectivity, so she was going to have to deal with all this with phone calls and visits to banks and what not.

"I used to steal alcohol for weekends and give people free groceries in my old Supermarket job. I began working for one of the main UK supermarkets after I left school and started college a few decades ago. I knew a few people working there, including a couple friends of mines that would party with me at weekends. I started in the cafe section (mostly just stole buttered toast there lmao) but eventually got moved to the top tier of the peasant employees - the tills! One friend and I were often next to each other on tills or just a few spaces between us. We would get high in her car during our breaks and use receipt paper to write messages back and forth that would often send us into mad giggles. I actually still have some somewhere haha.. I remember literally having to hide my head under the till desk because I could not contain my laughter (think desperately holding back laughter while getting into trouble by teachers at school lol) while a decently sized queue - at one of the most busiest periods of the day - waited for me to begin scanning. I think I pretended I dropped a pen or some shit so i could pull myself together😂

Anyway context given, time to confess my crimes..

I liked scanning fast, much of the time way too fast for the scanner to pick up on the item. That would usually mean you pull item back and rescan till it beeps. But my friends **imaginary for legal purposes and post rules** who had been on tills longer than me would purposefully not scan a decent amount of my shopping anytime I was lucky enough to shop while they were on. So I had to pay it forward obviously! Family, friends and strangers alike all struck luck anytime they queued at my till and had a nice surprise when the amount wasn't as much as expected. 

My **imaginary** friends also showed me how we got our free alcohol for the weekends... one of us would go in when we knew another was on tills and pick up a few bits including our preferred bottle of spirits and mixers etc. Anytime anyone bought alcohol a warning about age restricted items would pop up and we either had to click that they were 'of age'/ or that they were underage/ had no ID. It all sounded and looked the same to shift leaders, other than we usually take the alcohol away if we cant verify legal age. But we would just click underage/no ID, pretend we pressed the other option and slide that glass bottle on down to be bagged up with the rest of the stuff (that we would pay for lol) No one was ever any the wiser 🥸 

Management were bellends and I walked an hour into my last shift after a disciplinary meeting about a shift I had taken off after a cousin took his own life. This was only 6 months after losing my first love in a car accident so I was retriggered about that and obviously devastated over this family loss.. so they weren't happy I was taking time off again after all the time I'd had off when my boyfriend died. So I quit there and then and walked out. Place was so toxic and cliquey! 

Also while I worked cafe they served fish that had maggots and there were tiny flies in every vinegar bottle.. was the worst part of supermarket to work! My next job was in a seafood factory and honestly still one of my favourite jobs I've worked. Except in winter.. omg those 5am freezing cold starts were brutal.

"I cant stop thinking about my camp counselor. Its been 2 years. Met him when I was 15 (f) and he was 19. At subsequent camps, though there was never any flirting or ANYTHING weird on his part, we had a spark. Whilst barely knowing each other had a conversation that lasted over 3 hours one time. I got fanny flutters at the prospect of just seeing him- its hard to put to words how incredibly attractive I find this man. His smile makes me want to melt into the ground and never get up again. Im now 18 and I havent seen him for a year but I feel the exact same way and have never been able to forget about him.

CONTEXT: I met him during a time in my life when I felt incredibly lonely and thinking of him I know was a way of escaping the emptiness I felt around me. But what I felt for him I think was totally real and to this day ive never felt similarly about anyone else. Now when I think about him it just makes me sad because realistically we have no chance of being together anytime soon and he doesnt really seem interested in me much, the times we occasionally message. But he also doesn't know I've turned 18 so wouldn't have to feel weird anymore about showing interest?  So maybe things would be different if I could find a way to tell him? Or am I just kidding myself? But I can't stop thinking we'd be amazing together.

Ser hipócrita es mostrar una cara que no es la nuestra, hacer lo que los demás esperan, aunque por dentro estemos rotos.

Todos publicamos lo que queremos que los demás vean: sonrisas, viajes, éxitos. Pero, ¿quién muestra sus peores días? ¿Quién muestra la soledad, el miedo o el cansancio?

"Me and my friend stole burgers from Wendy’s in the late ‘90s. Back in middle school — and well into high school — me and my best friend were really in to phreaking, prank calls, etc. It was all harmless stuff to keep ourselves entertained. Most pranks were based on challenges such as “how long can you go.” The idea was to keep the other party on the phone for as long as possible. Our record was ~ 23 minutes to order a single pizza. 

My friend had multi-line phones at his house (one ISDN, and 3 regular landlines) so we decided to start doing conferenced prank calls. We’d often dial 6 digits, switch to the second line and dial 7, then switch back and dial the final digit, and connect the two random people or stores.

One day we decided to have some fun. We wrote up a script — along with talking points and possible questions from the employees —  and called up several Wendy’s locations around town with the same spiel: “hello, please get the manager, and hold for corporate.” It took us a couple hours to call every location (in groups of 4) with managers who were present. 

The pitch went something like this:

“This is Wendy’s corporate franchise development. We’re losing sales to McDonalds because we don’t have a Big Mac equivalent. That changes today. 

We’re giving each location an opportunity to create something to go up against the Big Mac. We thought the ‘Big Wendy’ might turn off customers, so we’re calling it the double-double Wendy Wendy for now. 

You have one week to work together to create your own version of what you think a Big Mac competitor should look and taste like. Starting next Friday, and throughout the following week, a customer will ask for two double-double Wendy Wendy meals. You will ask them what kind of beverage they would like, then instruct them to pull aside while you prepare their meal. You’ll make two double-double Wendy Wendys, and serve them with two Biggie fries and two Biggie drinks of their choice. They will not be charged for this.”

Most of the questions were along the lines of “what should we do for sauce, and what about the middle bun?” We told them to think of something, as that’s part of the fun, and the winning recipe would net everyone a healthy reward. 

Flash forward to the following Friday, we tried it out. The first location had no idea what we were talking about, so we left. The second one took about ten minutes to bring us our meals, but it worked! We visited 5 more locations that week, and dined like kings.",confession,neutral,17

"Sort of made horrible prayer, not sure if due to ocd or not This is going to confuse a lot of people but I’ll try my best. OCD could be tricking me. I don’t know. But I’ll do my best to explain. Warning: there are some extremely sensitive themes including racism.

OCD has caused me to worry about making bad prayers. It is mainly an anxiety of what others would think of if I prayed for something bad. Basically, it can think of something bad, and I can think of why I want it, and say “amen” pretty easily. Not sure if that constitutes a prayer really since it is ocd driven, and might even feel more real to me than it actually is, but it gets very complicated.

None of this makes any logical sense to anyone but me, but to me it makes sense and that’s the issue. My mind invented something where I can pray to pray for something. Yes, that’s right, and it makes no sense. Essentially these ideas for prayers come in automatically. I don’t necessarily choose them. I can somewhat choose how I react, but that is where it gets tricky. OCD also blunts my emotions with certain prayers or makes things feel more real than they are

So, what happened, is my ocd targeted the theme I was most worried about having a bad prayer about, which was unfortunately racism. In the past, I made a mistake that was racist (I won’t get into what it was here), and I thought about it a lot. I imagined people never wanting to forgive me and saying I deserve to suffer forever. Additionally, worrying about making racist prayers made this go up. It was frustrating, because with ocd it can take what people say too literally. So if someone says: “you deserve to suffer,” I might be thinking that thinking about it 10 hours a day for multiple months was justified. This made me have a misdirected frustration towards the people I perceived as yelling at me, which was unfortunately people of color.

Here’s where ocd comes in with the prayer obsession. OCD gave me the idea: well you’re so mad at them you could pray for them all to die. Unfortunately, with the prayer obsession I’ve had, I’ve had a bit of a history with doing bad prayers when I’m not feeling great, and I don’t know if that is just part of the ocd or not, or just doing them to do them. One example is world war 3. I don’t want people to get hurt, but when I was feeling horrible I thought “screw it, I’ll pray for it cause I want to die.” I knew God wouldn’t actually do it, and the normal me didn’t want him to. 

Then, and I don’t know why, it seemed extremely easy for a moment to pray for people of color to die, and I actually almost did it, but I stopped myself. This is where the praying to pray comes in. With ocd, if I have a moment where I almost did a bad prayer, my mind “saves” that mindset, and it is possible for me to go back to it any time. So this situation will present itself many times to me. With praying to pray, I can essentially be put back in the mindset at any time no matter what is going on, and by saying “amen,” my brain basically magically does it and it feels like the same thing. Because it feels real to me, it seems like the same thing as a prayer. Last night that is what I did for this and I regretted it less than a two seconds later. So basically, I ended up doing a prayer that was racist. This is exactly what happened in that moment.

This isn’t who I normally am (although my brain would disagree), but in that moment, with magical thinking, I prayed for all people of color to die, out of what my brain said was “hatred.” My brain also said I felt genuine hatred, but I don’t think I really do. I think it is all related to a misdirected frustration of feeling like I was yelled at, which stemmed from ocd. After the prayer, all those feelings were immediately gone. I don’t know how messed up my brain was, or how much of a role ocd played. It probably at least blunted my emotions. It sort of came on all of the sudden too, but I did it. I’m really sorry. I don’t hate people of color despite what my brain says, but I feel like I did something really bad. 

When I sit with what happened and don’t engage with it, it does not feel like a big deal at all. The guilt is almost all ocd driven. So I don’t know if that means there is something I’m missing or not. I might be missing something, but I know what happened in the moment",confession,neutral,2

"Can’t forget the way  she dressed and her body looked M27 Indian, living in the US. Just a few hours ago, I was out playing snooker with a friend at a bar. When we stepped outside, we noticed two girls—one Asian, the other African-American—smoking a joint nearby. While my friend went to get the car, I waited across the street.

He took about 5–7 minutes, which gave me some time to notice them from a distance. I found myself particularly drawn to the African-American girl—she had an athletic build that caught my eye. After a few minutes, she called out, ‘Do you have a lighter?’ Without thinking, I blurted out, ‘I don’t smoke, sorry,’ and they both laughed.

Soon after, my friend pulled up in his black Mustang. As I was getting into the car, I think I heard the Asian girl say to her friend, ‘You should’ve asked better.’ I’m still not sure if I heard that right, but it stuck with me. Honestly, part of the reason I didn’t approach them was that they looked a little young, and I didn’t want to take any chances.but God,I can’t forget her @ss",confession,neutral,0

"I went through my moms phone while at my mom’s bedside during her TBI My mom was in and out of consciousness; she had a stroke and a brain bleed. She was stable and had experienced the TBI that morning.
My mom has a history of seeking younger men. She has even went so far as to have relations with my sister’s boyfriend’s brother who was 23, my mom 49.
I’ve caught her with so many men. It’s like a fetish. Even the men she’s married are at least 7 years younger. I think it’s disgusting. My mom has a history of mental illness. She loved men who drink and do drugs. She always put men before me and my brothers and sisters.

While sitting beside her while she was resting, she was getting all kinds of messages, naturally.
In the social media chats and messages, I saw a familiar name of one disgusting, despicable individual of someone I used to know. A manchild. A manchild who is looking to be taken care of by a woman. He has no shame. This person used to want to date me. I kicked him to the curb and he fawned over me for months, even driving 30 miles out of the way to pass my house to see if I had someone over.

He was sexting my mom. She was entertaining it.
To this day, she has no idea that I know. It was really hard to learn this while she was hanging delicately between life and death. She’s made a full recovery (walking, talking, driving, holding a job) since then but I wish I could talk to her about it.

I feel bad for snooping, but I still feel disgusted by all of it. She knows I am sickened i am by him. I want him to have absolutely no access to me by any means. I think about this almost every single day since it’s happened.

Have I violated my mom’s space? I feel like she is perpetually a teenager and needs constant guidance. Still, I know it doesn’t justify what I did. I’m sorry mom, and now I wish that I didn’t know what I know..",confession,neutral,442

"ive been lying to myself, but here is everything going wrong right now I need to talk about this because i feel like it will make me more at peace with it/make my mind clearer. Throwaway because i had my face in the other one. Please ask questions.

Im seventeen. i broke my $h streak after seven months. I was doing so well, told my parents and friends that i was doing so much better and i dont think i could bring myself to ever do it again. my dad frequently says that im obviously doing much better and it makes it hard to talk about it because i dont want to disappoint him.. Did it one night and instantly felt relieved. God knows why.  My mum is a classic asian parent, but shes gotten so much better at catering to my emotional and mental needs even though i know the idea to her is confusing. My dad is strict in all the wrong ways, for the wrong things i think. I love them both but they make me feel really at war with myself. I can go into detail about what they have both done if you ask. 

I am failing year 11, i cant concentrate, my head hurts and i blank as soon as i read too much. My memory is beyond bad, its almost like i am 80 years old.I constantly over sexualise myself because i feel like thats all im good for; but i’m afraid of sex due to only one bad experience. i ‘m constantly stuck between wanting to be skinny and curvy. Too scared to lose my boobs because its the only thing people acknowledge me for. I get offered money for sexual services, even though i have never offered, and the idea disgusts me. I am stuck on my first boyfriend and he hurt me so bad, and im ashamed that i go back everytime he is bored. I am talking to him currently and its eating at me, i know i am not the only one again. I cant even look or be near another guy anymore, with out instantly leaving/cancelling/ghosting. 

I am a bad friend and never had a friendship that wasnt fueled by my own jealousy, i guess because im so unhappy with myself. Im a two faced bitch who will do anything for people to like me, but if they dont like me, or we fall out, (or even if i think they will hurt me), i switch up and become so nasty i dont even recognise myself. If someone hurts me even a tiny bit, i will go to the ends of the earth to ruin that persons life, and have.

I go through phases where i want to be gone, and where i cant imagine anything better than life. I just want to make it to my 18th birthday, but its becoming a struggle. I am not sad, i am not angry, i am not tired, i am just nothing. Every morning i crawl my way to the end of the day. Sleeping is the only peace i get. Dont know how long i can go like this. Feeling nothing is almost worse than i was really sad.",confession,neutral,3

"Today, I [19 F], on my birthday, lost the only person I was living for ❤️ I turned 19 today. I still don't know what to type or how to say all this, but I got the news that my mother passed away today.

Recently, I moved to an entirely new state for college. Ever since the age of 10, I have struggled with making friends — it's not like people don't talk to me, it's just that they only talk when they need favors, like notes or help. I have tried forming close friendships, but for some reason, I have always been treated as if I’m not part of the group.
I have struggled with my gender identity and sexual orientation growing up too.
Last year, I got into a good college after giving one of the toughest exams in the country. I had hoped that I would interact with people and try my best to change myself. Unfortunately, college was even worse than my school days. There was a hell of a lot of groupism from the start — based on what language you spoke. There were two majority languages — and unfortunately, I spoke neither. Even though I tried, I was alienated from day one.
I now had no real people to talk to in college; just a few people who spoke to me only when they needed notes or help.
At that time, the only thing that kept me sane was talking to my mother. She had always been there for me and never judged me for struggling with all this.
Every day, I talked to her for hours and shared every single thing with her.
I have been suicidal for the past 3–4 years, but the only reason I never did anything was because of her.

I don't have a good relationship with my dad. He abused me physically and mentally while I was growing up. Even though now he has realized the error of his ways — and I would say he knows he was wrong — the trauma he gave me is too much.

Every year, I used to celebrate my birthday with my mother only (as I didn’t really have any other close people). I would get a text from 2–3 'friends,' so things still felt somewhat okay.

This year, in college, we have a group chat made specially just to wish birthdays — but no one cared to wish me.
I even jokingly told some people the day before that it was my birthday, hoping they would write something in the group — but no one did.
Yes, I know that's embarrassing, but I was that desperate. I wanted my college birthday to be better.
What's worse is that one of them, whom I had told it was my birthday, texted me — but only to ask for notes.
I wished he had just written two words — just two words: Happy Birthday.

I was waiting for my mother to call and wish me at midnight, but surprisingly, she didn’t.
I thought maybe she had fallen asleep since she had to work early.
Even though I was disappointed, I reassured myself because I knew she was the only one who was going to wish me today.
Waking up in the morning, my dad informed me that my mother had passed away in her sleep (due to natural causes).
I couldn't believe anything.
I am still not able to process everything.

But I know one thing — the person I lived for these past years is no longer here.
And today, in a few hours:

I will go out for the last time, take a round of my campus (my campus is extremely beautiful, and one of the other reasons I stayed sane),

and then I will come back to my room — and, hopefully, I will join her too in the afterlife today itself. ❤️",confession,neutral,175
"Because of something that happened in high-school, at my core I know I’m a monstrous person. I am an awful human being. Male in all the ways the men are afraid to be. It would be unfair to all men that share the same hormones and large frame as me to attribute to my awfulness to my gender. But to pretend that my maleness does not influence the aspects of myself of which I am most of ashamed of would be silly.
               To get more to the source of my self revulsion I have to elaborate on the night where I think I truly revealed myself— my true heart. At the time I was dating my high-school girlfriend, Rose, and we had plans to stay at her friend’s condo in a nearby city so we could party with people we knew but weren’t too close with. I drove both her and the friend there.
                At the condo/party I was especially liberal with my drinking. One shot, down went three more, two more with an unholy cocktail of vodka and Mountain Dew Baja Blast, so on and so on. Completely wasted. More drunk than I had ever been before or since. I didn’t remember anything besides the actual act of drinking that night. It was an uncomfortably long gap in my memory. The morning after was a bit hazy as well, but I do remember that something was wrong in my girlfriend’s face. She had been crying and she told me she hadn’t slept.
                 The ride home was really tense. I kept asking Rose what happened but she wouldn’t say. Not with the friend in the car. After a bit of back and forth through the Notes app on my phone (a note I still have and look at often) we decided to pull over at a gas station to talk.
                 The conversation that followed was an extremely hard one. Through heavy tears she explained that I had made her and the friend extremely uncomfortable the night before. From her account, I had hit on her friend right in front of her. Repeatedly and pathetically. “Hit on” might not be the right phrase as it conjures images of of bachelors trying to “score” at bars and stuff. The image conjured by what Rose was saying was one of a potential rapist. I was following the friend around the condo, telling her how pretty she was, complimenting her clothes, calling myself her “step boyfriend”, all culminating in a skin crawling event where I told her “we’re going to fuck.” Not even a request, a declaration. One with the likely under tones of “whether you like it or not.” After this, I apparently passed out in the bedroom which Rose and I shared. I think the correct phrase for this situation would be “sexual harassment.”
                 I was convulsing in sobs when she finished. I remember her consoling me which was a kind act I know I didn’t really deserve. She confided that the fact that I remember nothing from that night made it a thousand times more complicated. Does it really though? While I do wish that I could have those memories back just to fully understand why I did and said those things, I don’t think I was a different person. At some core level, those insanely creepy words came from me. Also, the fact that I willingly drank so much represents a choice to dangerously lower my inhibitions. How could I have known though? How could I have known that my true core, one without the mental blocks of inhibitions, was a six foot tall man demanding sex from a woman who thought she could trust him. All things about myself point to a stand up trustworthy guy. Almost all my friends are women, I have two sisters who I practically raised, I’m good friends with all of my ex’s (excluding Rose for understandable reasons), all of those women would trust me with their lives. I get told I’m sweet, charming, thoughtful, a sensitive and empathetic person who really cares. Why then, for that night, was I completely detestable. A wolf in sheep’s clothing. No, not even for that night, read the “I”s and “me”s of this post. Complete narcissism. Explaining and excusing an event that was nobody’s fault but my own and having  the audacity to be self pitying about it.
               Anyways, Rose and I broke up. The breakup wasn’t quick. It was months long with a thousand long talks to see if we could salvage the broken trust. I’ve never loved anyone or anything as much as I loved her which makes the events of that night a tragic point in both of our lives. The friend left for college and no one’s talked to her since. I haven’t seen either of them in years. I know I hurt them both. Not in any physical way but in a lasting mental way. When I try to put myself in their shoes that night (which I do obsessively) I can’t escape the truth. I am a horrible human being",confession,neutral,38

"arguing with strangers, friends, or partners turns me on. this has been a thing since i f(23) was a kid. i remember when id argue with other girls in school or even go back and forth online, it excited me. i thought this meant this person must like me because they’re entertaining and giving me attention. this is when i realized tension wasn’t just tension in my head. even when i had “beef” with other girls i still imagine making out with them sometimes instead of fighting. even when i didn’t like the girl. 

now as an adult in the rare instance that i do go back and forth with a stranger online or someone im dating, i tend to say things that bounce off of what they say. i try to find clever replies and when they react to it, i get excited- almost like we’re writing a poem together . i do not enjoy bringing turmoil to others. but after a debate with even someone i may not know online, i be wanting to text them after and hold conversations. often times i get the thought “is this person flirting with me” which i laugh it off. but i can’t help but to feel a little intrigued or turned on going back and forth with other people. gender doesn’t matter and i don’t even have to know what the person looks like. if lm (sleeping with, dating, talking to, focused on, etc), to someone i can easily feed into the drama and drag things out, for the tension to me appears as sexual tension. luckily i have a strong mindset and i don’t personally argue anymore due to my anxiety. but sometimes i can’t tell when im trolling too much and actually bothering people. idk if it matters but i am pansexual so it doesn’t make a difference who im talking to really. 

idk if this makes sense. but this is one of those odd ass traits of mine that i can’t just go without telling someone.

"I’ve lied and gotten away many times about being a twin to people who I’ve just met. I’ve lied and gotten away many times about being a twin to people who I’ve just met. I have told countless people over the course of my life I am a twin. I am indeed not a twin. But every time anyone would ask me if I was a twin to someone they saw, I would say yes and never tell the truth. 

You see, I am of mixed race. 50/50 black and white. I don’t see many people like me in my day to day life. In school growing up, it was rare to be in a class or even in a school, with someone who had my exact skin complexion and hair texture. But whenever I did, people would instantly think me and whoever was also biracial, were related. 

My classmate (later friend) and I were sitting in the same group the first day of school when someone asked if we were twins. I instantly said yes but that we have different last names because our parents divorced and decided to surrender full custody of one of us and move away to make it fair. He ran with it and we never told anyone. Even the teacher thought we were telling the truth. I’ve done this numerous times with other biracial people who I encounter and get to know using random lies that sound almost unbelievable but not quite. No one (who didn’t actually know me) has ever suspected me of lying. I do feel bad about certain lies I used because some of my lies were actually kind of dark and happen in real life. I don’t do that joke anymore since I’ve discovered that the real world is not so funny. 

Edit: I shouldn’t say I was never suspected by anyone because truly I don’t know that but I was never called out on it if someone did suspect is a better way of saying that.",confession,neutral,219
"odio mia madre e odio anche il cibo, mi voglio deprimere che due palle, non ho voglia di fare tutto il contesto perché mi viene solo da piangere e deprimermi, però purtroppo un po' lo devo fare.

sono una femmina di 14 anni, nella mia famiglia SPECIALMENTE CON MIA MADRE, anzi praticamente tutto per colpa sua, c'è un brutto rapporto con il cibo, spesso fa commenti su quello che mangio e le quantità.

sono una persona che comunque un po' ci soffre per queste cose, ammento che odio il mio fisico e farei di tutto per cambiarlo.
sono abbastanza sicura di avere un disturbo alimentare, collego la fame alle emozioni, quando sono nervosa mi abbuffo e lo stesso succede se sono triste o in ansia.
dopo le abbuffate mi è capitato di vomitare varie volte.

spesso mi vergogno, e quindi lo nascondo, del cibo che mangio, per esempio se faccio merenda al pomeriggio, cerco di non farlo notare a mia madre o comunque in generale alla mia famiglia.
mi crea disagio sapere che nella famiglia sono quella che mangia di più(dopo mio padre), e mi crea disagio sapere che mia sorella più grande, è molto più magra di me e ha un fisico perfetto.

oggi è il suo compleanno e siamo andate a fare shopping insieme. quando ci stavamo provando i vestiti,
lei si alza la maglia e mi rendo conto di quanto io sia più in carne di lei, non me ne ero mai resa costo veramente, però oggi mi sono sentita veramente male a vedere la sua taglia di pantaloni in confronto alla mia, e la cosa peggiore è che lei se ne era accorta che ero a disagio e non sapeva come fare, ovviamente io ho cercato il più possibile di non farlo notare, e lo stesso lei, però ero veramente triste di questa cosa.

quando siamo tornate a casa, io ero veramente triste, al centro commerciale sono riuscita a prendere solo un jeans, che tra l'atro non mi convinceva neanche, tutte le cose che avevo provato mi stavano malissimo, non riuscivo ad essere felice e ho paura che mia sorella l'abbia notato.

stavo quasi per mettermi a piangere dentro al camerino quando mi stavo provando l'ennesimo top per l'estate.

quando torniamo a casa sono dovuta andare a ritirare la sua torta di compleanno, e insieme mia madre mi ha detto di prendere le mandorle pralinate, (non so se si chiamano così, ma nel caso sono quelle mandorle avvolte dallo zucchero/caramello) e io ne volevo troppo una, ma questo significava che dovevo aprire io il sacchetto per prima, e mi vergognavo troppo, quindi ho deciso di aspettare.
quando arriva mia sorella lo apre e ne prende una, così io  colgo l'occasione e ne prendo qualcuna.

dopo un po' ne prendo un'altra, e un'altra ancora (intanto mia sorella se ne era andata, c'era solo mia madre) e mia madre mi dice ""smettila di mangiare quella roba, fa malissimo"" e io non rispondo, di solito quando mi dice queste cose non rispondo mai, faccio finta di nulla.
dopo un po', tipo 15 minuti, ne prendo unam
stavo guardando il telefono quindi non me ne ero accorta subito, infatti ho realizzato dopo, però poi mi sono accorta che quando ho alzato la testa dal telefono mia madre non era più nella stanza, ma vedeneola uscire dalla stanza ho visto che si stava mettendo il pacchetto nella tasca, come se volesse portarlo via da me, per evitare che lo mangiassi....ci sono rimasta veramente di merda. 

l'ha fatto come se fossi una ragazzina in sovrappeso da salvare...ok che non mi piace il mio fisico, ma so distinguere una persona sovrappeso da una persona LEGGERMENTE rotonda, non mi reputo grassa, le persone grasse sono altre, e sarei un ipocrita a definirmi grassa, ma di sicuro non sono magra, ho un po' di pancetta e le cosce grosse, ma mi sembra molto esagerata la reazione di mia madre.

"I sh*t and threw up all over myself at college in the public restroom, naked. Throw away because no one must ever know. I was in college suffering from food poisoning in my freshman year. After tossing and turning for hours, struggling with cold sweats and stomach cramps I finally fell asleep. Suddenly at about 4AM I woke up with the instant need to go. That night my boyfriend was over so I decided to just sleep in my underwear since my roommate was not in the room that night. I was against the wall on those god forsaken twin beds and threw myself over him. Before I could find where I had thrown my shirt it was already too late. I could feel it coming out and there was nothing stopping it. I decided to make a bee line to the bathroom, fortunately I was right next to the public shared rest room. I ran into the big handicap stall to give me as much room as possible. I sat on the toilet and before I could react I threw up all over my already soiled underwear, the floor, and myself. By the time it all subsided I started panicking. I was now in the public restroom, covered in vomit and diarrhea, completely naked. After listening for anyone in the hallway, I made a mad dash over to the showers. I cleaned myself off as fast as humanly possible, listened for anyone again, peaked out into the hallway and upon seeing the coast was clear sprinted to my dorm room. I practically slammed the door shut and flicked on the lights. My boyfriend then sprung to life just to see his drowned rat of a partner, shaking like a leaf, sobbing. He asked what happened and I broke down. He helped me dry off and made sure I was ok before he let me leave, fully dressed this time, to go clean up the floor (I’m not a monster). While cleaning I buried my underwear at the bottom of the industrial trash can and cleaned up the rest of the mess.

"Claire and Thomas where the opposite is up to you to see what you think about it CLAIRE – Before him

I was coming out of two long relationships. One too lukewarm, the other too chaotic. I had learned to protect myself. I read a lot about emotional dependence, narcissistic perverts, manipulation mechanisms. I wanted to be “lucid”, no longer fall into the traps of disguised passion.

When I installed this app, it wasn't to find love. I just wanted to talk, maybe find some human warmth. I wasn't expecting him.

THOMAS – Before her

I was coming back from a breakup that had drained me. I spent months recovering. I did therapy. I read everything I could about attachment, relationships, the mistakes I had made. I was ready to love again, but this time, differently. I promised myself to say what I feel, not to play anymore, not to hide.

When I saw Claire, I knew it wouldn’t be a meeting like any other. She had a light. An intensity. And a dark side, too, that I recognized in her as in mine.

⸻

Claire's voice

I met him on a Thursday evening, on an app. From the first messages, there was a kind of rare fluidity. In two hours, we already had private jokes, we shared our dreams, our childhood wounds. He said very beautiful, very profound things, and I had this strange feeling: “Either he’s the man of my life, or he’s going to break me into a thousand pieces.”

The first meeting, two days later, was perfect. He looked at me like I was the only woman on Earth. He was attentive, funny, attentive. He walked me home. He took me in his arms. I felt seen. And it's been a long time since I felt like that.

But very quickly, it became… invasive. Messages from morning to evening. “I miss you” from the second week. Discussions about “our future”, as if we had been together for months. And when I told him that I needed time to breathe, he got upset. He told me that I was putting up walls, that I was afraid of loving.

I asked myself: is he manipulating me? Is he flattering me just to have me under control? He told me about his exes who “hurt him”, how he was “too nice”. I read articles about love bombing. Everything coincided. And then one day he exploded because I canceled a dinner. He told me that I wasn't invested, that I was playing a game. There, I said to myself: that's typical of a narcissistic pervert. He made me feel guilty, even though I was just setting a limit.

So I ended the relationship. And I was left with this bitter taste: how could something so beautiful become so suffocating, so quickly?

⸻

Thomas' voice

When I met Claire, I had a shock. She was brilliant, funny, intense. We talked for hours. She knew right away where to touch me. It was like she already knew me.

I wanted to give him everything. I wanted her to know that I was sincere. I wrote him spontaneous messages, I shared my thoughts, my memories, my fears. She responded enthusiastically at first. Then I felt a change. Less present. Less demonstrative. I thought she was moving away. I was scared.

So I insisted. I told myself that if I did more, she would see that I was there for real. But the more I tried, the more it closed. One day, she told me that I was “putting pressure on her.” That I was doing “too much”. Yet I just wanted to show her that she mattered.

Then she started to doubt everything. She once told me that my compliments sounded fake, “like learned scripts.” She asked me if I often manipulate women like that. I was shocked. Hurt. It wasn't a technique. It was me.

And when she canceled that dinner, I broke down. I felt rejected, humiliated. So yes, I reacted strongly. Too strong. But I didn't want to lose her. And she left. Without another word.

⸻

Week 1 – The obvious

CLEAR
Everything happened very quickly. The messages were so fluid, funny, deep. He spoke to me as if he had known me forever. He knew how to ask words, questions, listen. He told me I was “obvious”. I smiled, but deep inside I felt a shiver. Who says that so quickly?

THOMAS
She captivated me from the start. Each exchange made me want to know more. She spoke to me with lucidity and modesty, a form of restraint that was beautiful to observe. I let myself go. I said what I felt. I wanted her to know I wasn't playing. That I wanted to build, not just consume.

⸻

Week 2 – Intensity

CLEAR
He called me every evening. He wanted to hang out, all the time. I was flattered… then a little worried. He told me “I adore you”, then “I feel like we could live together”. I raised an internal flag: This is love bombing. It's too much, too soon.

But at the same time, he was so sincere. If present. So I said to myself: give him a chance. And I fell a little more.

THOMAS
She was more distant, sometimes. She took a while to respond. I told myself she was scared. I wanted to reassure her. Show him that I was stable, reliable. I told her that I thought of her often. She responded, but less and less warmly.

I didn't understand. I was afraid she would move away. So I put more energy into it. No more words. Maybe too much.

⸻

Week 3 – The changeover

CLEAR
I started to feel oppressed. He told me that I was running away from intimacy. That I had “walls”. He got worried whenever I took a step back. I had the impression that he was monitoring my silences.

One evening, I read an article about toxic relationships. It ticked a lot of boxes. I panicked. I said to myself: What if he was an unconscious manipulator? One of those who love intensity but hate the freedom of others?

I didn't want to go back to being that woman who gets lost.

THOMAS
I felt it slipping through my fingers. I just wanted us to really talk. But she was elsewhere. I insisted. I told him I was scared. She said I was projecting too much, that I was invading her.

I felt betrayed. Rejected for my sincerity. I wondered if she was emotionally available. If she wasn't the discreet manipulator, who gets attention then shuts down as soon as she gets it.

⸻

Week 4 – The breakup

CLEAR
I canceled a dinner. He reacted very badly. He criticized me for “running away from love”, for not being ready. He said I hurt him on purpose. I heard: you are guilty of not loving me the way I want. And then I knew I had to leave. Because I couldn't breathe in this bond anymore.

I told him I needed space. That it wasn't against him. But he didn't want to hear. So I ended it.

With a strange feeling: that of having fled a danger... or an ill-born love.

THOMAS
She told me I was too intense. That I was suffocating him. She left me by message. I sat there like an idiot, reviewing our conversations. I didn't understand. I reread everything with a cold gaze. And I saw what people call love bombing. I was afraid: What if I was that without knowing it?

But deep down, I know not. I know that I loved as best I could, clumsily but with heart. And that she also did her best

What they didn't see

Claire and Thomas were two sincere souls, but each carried an invisible bag on their back, filled with old wounds, doubts, old terrors. And it is these bags, heavy and silent, which dictated their story as much, if not more, than their true desire to love.

Claire grew up with the idea that love could confine, suffocate, control. Perhaps because she experienced relationships where admiration quickly turned to possession. Perhaps also because we loved her for her visible qualities (her beauty, her intelligence) but rarely for her flaws, her hesitations, her silences. She learned to be wary of those who “want too much,” because, in her experience, wanting too much necessarily meant wanting to change her, or to possess her.
So, when Thomas showed himself to be demonstrative, expressive, full of shared desires, Claire did not see a man who clumsily tried to love her; she saw potential danger. His brain didn't hear ""I care about you"", it heard ""I'm going to grab you"".
She did not see that she herself, by moving away to protect herself, was amplifying Thomas' anxiety - which led him to insist even more.

Thomas has what psychologists call an anxious attachment. When he feels the connection becoming important, his insecurity rises. He said to himself: “If I don’t prove right away that I am worthy of being loved, she will leave.” He does not seek to control; he seeks to reassure, clumsily, through excess presence, through words that are too big, too quickly.
When Claire began to take a step back — which was a healthy way for her to preserve herself — Thomas did not perceive it as a simple need for space. He experienced it as an imminent abandonment. And in his panic, he did exactly the wrong thing: he squeezed harder.
He didn't see that Claire didn't need more attention; she needed time, air, trust left at a distance.

Both, prisoners of their interpretation, missed the essential:
	• Claire did not see that Thomas was sincere in his awkwardness, that he did not want to invade her but only to be reassured.
	• Thomas failed to see that Claire was not cold or disinterested, but cautious, slow to trust, and that she needed to experience her freedom in order to love.

They read each other's signs not with their hearts, but with their scars.
They put modern words to their ancestral fears: narcissistic pervert, love bombing, toxic relationships, even though they were just two poorly tuned humans, each frightened in their own way.

They have not understood that love, sometimes, begins precisely where it is scary.
Where we should learn to say:
	• “When you move away, I’m afraid. But I want to respect your need for air.”
	• “When you invade me, I close myself. But I don’t want to reject you, just feel free.”

But neither of them knew how to put these words together in time.

Then, in the silence of their unspoken fears, the budding love was extinguished.

"I may have manipulated a guy into loving me and change his life as well Apologies in advance as this might be a mess. TempThrowaway acc obv. I'm afraid my partner would find this but I really want to let this off of my chest.
During 2023 while I was browsing on MRM (myreadingmanga) website where a porn ad came thru and that's where something weird happened. I saw a guy that looked really familiar on the intrusive webcam ad and i clicked on it to find out it's my high-school bully. Mind you he's not bully bully but jus annoying, childish, name calling, pulling my pants down kind of bully. At first i couldn't believe my eyes like it can't be him but his username and His IRL name is similar (like Chris XXXson). I watched for a while where he pleasure himself while interacting with the viewers. At first I jus wanted to mess with him a bit but then I was really drawn to him to the point that I created an account, interact with him and even spend money. He's not a big camboy or whatever it's called. Usually it's 2 digits to jus a couple viewers but i was obsessed with him and everytime i got off work. I would look him up, chat with him, send coins. Throughout this I confirmed it's really is him but I was already obsessed with him. After some months later, I learn about him alot and I really want to reach out to him but scared that I would come off as a creep so I tried to reconnect with my old friends to find out about him. After sometimes, i figured out thay he's unemployed, staying with his sister and whereabouts. I hang around his area to see him and i did. I've always thought of myself as a loner who would grow old as a single uncle but seeing him was like something reachable, within my grasp if I make my moves right. I've never had that kind of confidence in anywhere and it felt good. I remember i was shaking with excitement and I knew I gotta do it. And so i did. I try to bump into him at his usual go to convince store and act all surprise and guilt trip him into buying me beer for bullying me in high-school. He was sincerely apologising and all which i find it very cute. I got that beer bar date. There I planned it all out. Joking about old times, reminiscing about high school and all the fun things and then got him to go for a walk in a park with more beer cans in hand with me. I had it all. We couldn't stop talking about everything including his life and where he's been which I already know ofcourse. I comforted him and the next thing i know, he got all emotional and we were making out on the bench at night. I walk him back to his home where his sister is worried sick. The next day, i text him and hit him up. One thing i had to lie at that time was how i knew his number and his address which i got all from a friend. I jus swept it under by saying he was too drunk when he give it to me. From that day on, I hit him up IRL and on that cam website. He always chat about life and whatever topic he has on his mind when there are very few viewers but I was always there. On there as an online stranger, i tried to push him into my way. A lot of things happen during that until one day he really went out on a proper date with me. I was pursuing him in IRL but subtly. I learned more about him during our 2 months where i learn he has a passion for baking but never really got into so I encourage and put him as apprentice in a local bakery using my connections which he is very thankful for. After a while, he announced on the website that he's turning a new leaf and leaving the cam site and I even congratulated him and send him a final tip. He never mentioned about the website to me IRL tho. 8 months of dating in and I had him move in with me, where he would bake breads and pastries for me. We are head over heels for each other. We celebrated 1 year anniversary like 5 months ago and now we're planning to save up money to open up his own shop. My house smells of bake goods and he is trying his best for the shop. Sure i feel like such a manipulator sometimes but I love this man so much. His sister loves me too. It's a little family i got. I aim to marry him next year if all goes well. From jus wanted to mess with him to him making a mess out of me everyday. I want to let this whole thing out to him but i don't even want a single dent in my relationship with him. I cherish him and he knows it. God this was the single bravest thing i ever did and I'm loving it everyday. I sometimes feel like I litreally went with my gut like a villain, a mastermind.

"I once faked having a twin brother for three months just to ghost a girl I didn’t know how to break up with. I (29M) honestly don’t know why I’m thinking about this today, but it’s been eating at me for years.

When I was about 23, I dated this girl I met at a party. She was super into me way faster than I expected. After two weeks, she was already talking about moving in, naming our future kids, getting matching tattoos — full speed ahead.

I didn’t have the guts to just tell her it was too much.
Instead of ending it like a normal person, I made the worst decision of my life:
I pretended to die.

Kinda.

I created a fake Facebook profile pretending to be my “twin brother” (let’s call him “Jake”) and messaged her saying that I had tragically passed away in a “freak hiking accident.”
I literally googled a photo of a random mountain and posted it like it was a memorial.

She was devastated. I felt kind of bad… but also a little relieved.
I thought that would be the end of it.

Nope.

She reached out to “Jake” constantly. At first it was condolences. Then it was weird things like, “I think you’re the only one who understands my pain,” and “Can we meet to mourn him together?”

It got so bad that I had to fake “moving across the country for a fresh start” just to shut it down.

I kept up the lie for THREE MONTHS before finally just deleting everything and disappearing.
To this day, she probably still thinks I’m dead.

"I described my current self in some words that pop up on my mind. I've been on earth for 8093 days — or 22 years, 1 month, and 26 days — or 265 months and 26 days.  
Well, there are infinite ways to describe how long I've been living, but they all amount to the same thing in the end: a mere measure of how close I am to the end — to death.

While writing this, I'm listening to music (""Hello""). It's been about 3 days since the last time I prayed.  
Today, I watched porn and masturbated.  
Today, I didn't work.  
Today, I spent the whole day lying down.  
Today is another terrible day, where the version of me I hate the most takes over.

This isn't clear to the people around me.  
Maybe I look almost the same every day from the outside, but deep inside, I know the truth — and God knows it even better than I do: I'm doing worse than ever before.  
This addiction to watching that filth...  
This relationship that is Haram...  
This wasted time I spend watching random movies...

I don't know what kind of ""me"" I am creating for the long term.  
I don't see the big picture — in fact, I don't see any picture at all.  
Maybe, in the long term, this suffering is making me into the best version I could ever be — or is it?

Does being the best version of myself necessarily mean I must always do the uncomfortable, unwanted things, moment after moment, simply to be alive?  
Maybe that's what it should always be: to choose, at every moment, not the easy and comfy path, but the hard one.  
Why?  
Because life is short — *very* short — unexplainably short.  
Like the blink of an eye, years pass.

And looking back, the question arises:  
**Was it the best way I could've spent those years?**

I believe in God.  
I believe in the afterlife.  
And it's the most uncomfortable thing I can think about right now, because it's exactly what I'm running *against* — running *from* Allah, instead of running *to* Him.

Isn't this our life?  
A run toward the inevitable — toward certainty — toward death — toward Allah?  
But this life is, indeed, the biggest proof of whether we deserve the right kind of eternity or not:  
Either an eternity of pleasure, of learning, of growing, of getting closer and closer to Allah — an eternity of gaining knowledge, infinite knowledge...

When I now think about it, all of this life seems minuscule.  
It makes me question every single thing I do:  
Why not just leave everything behind — escape to a faraway land — and pray to Allah until death?

At the very first moment of eternity, all this life will be forgotten.  
I have already forgotten most of the life I have lived.  
Only some moments remain in my mind — and those moments were captured not just by me, but by others, by things, by beings.

But Allah sent us the Prophet (peace be upon him) to teach us that this is *not* the way He intended for us to live.  
Allah wants us to live together, to make the earth a better place, to wonder at what He has created, to marvel at the complexity, to try to understand it, even to try to mimic it — only to realize that we are, indeed, created.  
To see each other.  
To accept how different — and yet how similar — we are.

"If Hell is a place, I'm absolutely gonna get sent there It all started with a holiday dinner, about 15 years ago.

I took my oldest girls to the store to get the stuff we needed for dinner. While we're there, they start play fighting in the store. They were being really rough, and they knocked into a couple displays and had to pick up stuff. 

It was getting crazy because it was so crowded already, and they were acting like they had no home training. Which they definitely did, but they were in test limits mode because teenagers. 

At one point, I got really frustrated with them. I exaggerated my speach to make it seem that I was somewhat slow, and started soft yelling at them about how they were acting. 

They started laughing uncontrollably, and the people around us were mortified!!

But they stopped messing around and we got out of the store shortly after that.

Bonus: They stopped messing around in the store when they went with me after that. I would just ask if they want a repeat of the holiday shopping event.

"Is it weird that I get anxious making small talk even with people I've known all my life? This might sound dumb af to you guys, but I’ve been noticing it more and more lately. I get super anxious making small talk even with people I’ve known for literally all my life. Like chatting with a coworker at lunch or running into an old friend while grabbing coffee. It’s not that I don’t want to talk, I just feel this wave of nervous energy kick in and my brain starts scrambling for something “normal” to say.  
  
What’s extra frustrating is that I can handle deep conversations just fine. If we’re talking about something real like I’m totally comfortable. But if someone goes, “How was your weekend?” I immediately freeze, or give the most painfully boring answer possible, then spiral afterward wondering if I sounded weird.  
Like, this past weekend I did a few errands, caught up on laundry that I've been literally pushing away for the last 2 weeks and cleared out some old stuff I ended up selling online, but I still hesitated when someone asked me what I’d been up to. It’s like I assume no one actually wants to hear the real answer, so I end up second-guessing myself and giving some short, awkward reply instead.

What started off casual turned into a surprisingly fun exchange like so nostalgic, kind of random, but oddly grounding. We went down this rabbit hole of old-school snacks and bizarre lunchbox combos, and it made me laugh way more than I expected. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but afterward, I noticed I just felt full of life.  
  
It made me realize how often those tiny, unscheduled interactions sneak in and completely change the tone of your day. Just wanted to share this very nice (extremely rare for me) interaction that I had today.",offmychest,mixed,139
"After being lesbian for a decade, I realized I'm bisexual because of a vending machine. My girlfriend and I broke up before I started college and there at college there was this man who was literally everything I was.
It started when I noticed how funny he was, his humor was the same as mine. There was no attraction yet.
Then, one day I noticed just how alike we were.
Down to the speaking mannerisms.
He was tall.
He was patient and protective of me.
One day, I got a soda from the vending machine and he just so happened to notice it got stuck so he lifted this huge ass machine off the ground, shaking it, took it out for me and handed it to me with a wink.
There, at that moment, I accepted that there was no way I wasn't attracted to men, because he existed and as long as he existed I was some type of bisexual.
I was taken aback by his strength and it was then I noticed he had my eyes but they were softer, kinder.
So, there I sat, red in the face and having it slowly sink in.
I'm probably not gonna come out to anyone except here because I know it will never happen but I know it is possible now.
That is all.",offmychest,mixed,1157

"I am shocked at how many zoomers can't use computers I guess it comes from growing up in the 90s but I have always seen and heard computer literacy being linked with youth. All the time growing up I'd hear about how us kids just naturally took to computers and they were right. I remember teaching my mom how to set up her first email account when I was like 9 years old. Then years later showing her how to out music on her ipod etc. Everyone my age was proficient with computers right away and being bad at technology was seen as an old people thing.

Well now I'm in my 30s and it's like it's reversed. The younger employees where I work all have to be taught how to do very very basic computer tasks like logging in to windows, using Microsoft Word, using a browser to go to websites etc. And don't get me started on the chicken pecking typing, or using caps lock instead of shift.

They only know how to use phones and the app store. If there isn't an app for some web service they just straight up don't know how to get there.

Teaching them to use the computer at work feels exactly like teaching the boomers how to use the computer. What is going on??

And don't tell me they just know how to use different technology that I don't know how to use. Yes I do. I know how phones work and don't need any help doing anything on them.

I see on reddit all the time people not knowing they can go to reddit on their browser instead of the app.

I listen to 4chan greentext stories on YouTube while I do my paperwork and I've seen comments from people asking how to get the ""4chan app""

Does nobody have a laptop or whatever any more? I know that PC gaming is more popular now than ever so young people are definitely getting computers. High end computers at that. Is their whole computer experience strictly limited to Steam and the games they buy there? Do they know about the browser? If they had to, say, download and then open a PDF would they be able to do it?

Are zoomers the new boomers? Don't they teach computer basics in school anymore?",offmychest,mixed,149
"My mom came to my brother’s graduation but is skipping mine (which is today) — and I’m hurt. I (F) live in the U.S. and I’m about to graduate today from college. Ive been working hard for 4 years and this is very important to me. I told my mom (who lives out of the country) my graduation date a year ago so she could plan ahead. A few months ago, we found out my brother (who also lives in the States) is graduating a week before me. She said she’d go to his graduation, then travel down to mine, and fly back home the day after.

Fast forward to a month ago — she asked me to pay for plane tickets for her, my sister, and my stepdad, saying her card wasn’t working. (That’s always the excuse) I told her I couldn’t help because I was already tight on money with graduation expenses and bills. She said she’d pay me back within the week, but she has a pattern of borrowing money and never paying it back, so I was hesitant anyway. I also heard she asked someone else for money for plane tickets. Not surprising

Now she’s saying she can’t come to my graduation because our elderly dog (who lives with her) is sick and she needs to go back for him. For context, the dog had already been sick before my brother’s graduation, and she still traveled to see him. Someone is caring for the dog back home, so he would’ve been fine for the extra few days it would’ve taken to attend mine too.

I get it — the dog is family. But if she could leave him to go to my brother’s, why not mine? She was already in the states. I gave her a year’s notice, and it just feels like she didn’t make any real effort. It hurts to feel like I’m not a priority",offmychest,mixed,100
"My “bridesmaids-to-be” planned a girls trip without me. Now I don’t know if I even want them at my wedding. TLDR: My close friend group (potential bridesmaids) went on a trip without me. Sensing I’d be upset, the planner of the trip called after to “check in” to explain why. Now I’m questioning the friendship and their place in my wedding.

I’m struggling with how to move forward after this. I have a group of five close friends who I’ve always considered my core people—so close that they’d likely be my bridesmaids for my 2026 wedding (I haven’t officially asked, but it’s been understood).

Recently, one of them—let’s call her Anna—planned a weekend trip because her parents let her invite friends to the place they were renting. She invited everyone from our group except me. One girl even flew in from out of state. I’ve been talking for months about wanting to do a weekend trip with all of them, and I had no idea this was happening. I only found out when they started posting on our shared private story that I’m still in. I was literally the only one not there.

When I distanced myself afterward (short and delayed responses after I understood where I stand in this friendship), Anna called to “check in”—something she’s never done before. When I brought up the trip, she claimed it wasn’t intentional exclusion, just that it came together that way, and gave excuses about me being “always busy” and the trip being overwhelming with them number of people coming.

I told her honestly that it felt like they just didn’t want me there—that’s how it comes across when everyone in your friend group goes and doesn’t even tell you. She kept trying to defend it and said they’d “never intentionally hurt” me. When I asked her to imagine being in my shoes, her response was literally, “I hope you can also understand my position.” I ended the call politely and thanked her for reaching out, but it just felt like excuses.

Later, she followed up with a text that said something like, “Thanks for chatting, I value your friendship and I’m glad we could talk through it.” I didn’t respond directly—just gave it a thumbs up. To me, it felt more like damage control than accountability. Especially since she knows exclusion is a sensitive subject for me from a past incident. It feels like she reached out just enough to say she tried, in case anyone asked—but I’m still sitting with the fact that none of them thought to speak up for me.

What really stings is not just Anna organizing it—it’s that none of the others pushed for me to be there either. These are supposed to be my bridesmaids.

I’m trying to figure out how to move forward. Do I talk to the rest of them? Let it go? Reevaluate this entire friendship? Right now, I’m leaning towards cutting off. I’m not sure how I’d respond if they reached out asking to see me again. I’d love any advice or perspective.",offmychest,mixed,794
"Porn is fucking up how we see relationships Porn has fucking wrecked the way people see relationships. Straight up. It’s shoved sex into every goddamn corner of human connection where it never fucking belonged. Now everything’s sexualized — every bond, every glance, every moment that used to be innocent is fair game for someone’s sick fantasy. And it fucking destroys me to see how normalized this shit has become. You go on Reddit or Twitter or whatever, and people are just casually dropping confessions about having sexual thoughts about their own family, their coworkers, students, teachers, neighbors, and their partner’s fucking parents — like it’s nothing. Like it’s funny or hot or some dark little quirk to share. What the actual fuck? Is nothing off-limits anymore? Is any relationship still sacred?

And what’s even more fucked up is how so many people act like it’s no big deal — like as long as they don’t “act on it,” it’s somehow okay. Fuck that. That’s such a weak-ass excuse. Just having that shit in your head already means something’s broken. It's not just harmless fantasy — it’s a sign of rot. It shows how deep porn culture has infected people’s minds. They’ve been so desensitized that they genuinely believe they can sexualize anyone around them and it’s totally fine, as long as they keep it to themselves. That’s delusional. That’s dangerous. That’s fucking disgusting.

And let’s be real — this isn’t just about what someone jerks off to. It’s about how they see people. They stop seeing human beings and start seeing body parts. Roles. Fucking categories. Their whole view of relationships gets warped until every person they know becomes just another character in their porn-soaked imagination. That’s not normal. That’s not “kinky” or “dark” or “just fantasy.” That’s some mentally twisted shit. And it’s everywhere. It’s eating away at people's ability to love, to connect, to respect others like actual fucking humans. People are so deep in this shit they don’t even notice how far gone they are.

And no one’s calling it out. No one fucking talks about it because everyone’s either too scared to offend someone or they’re just as far gone. So the sickness keeps spreading. It becomes the default. It gets passed down. Kids grow up in this hypersexualized, boundaryless hellhole and think it’s normal to be turned on by a fucking stepmom or a cousin or a classmate. That’s not edgy, that’s not taboo — that’s fucked up. It’s cultural rot on a soul-deep level.

And honestly, it makes me wonder how many people have had to deal with that gut-wrenching feeling — when someone close, someone who should’ve been safe, looks at them in that wrong fucking way. Not a stranger. Not some random creep. But someone they knew. Someone who should never have had those kinds of thoughts. That shit fucks with your head. It stays with people. And it’s exactly the kind of quiet, hidden damage this porn-soaked culture creates — damage no one wants to admit is real because it’s uncomfortable or inconvenient or makes them look in the mirror.",offmychest,mixed,28

Then he started to talk about how it bothers him that i have slept with other men before our relationship and continued to compare the fighting and the bodycount… I am just at a loss for words.

"Update to: My girlfriend (16F) sleep(16M) with my best friend (16M) while we were apart ¿What I do? I wanted to thank you all for the messages of support I've received. I know we were in a time of separation, but for me, time is about getting better, not meeting new people, or in this case, sleeping with whoever you want. I also appreciate the advice.


I cut off all communication with José and my ex, blocked their numbers, and also unfollowed them on all possible social media.


On Tuesday, an unknown number started calling me. I'm not one of those people who answer unless they have a registered number, so I let it ring. Suddenly, I get a message saying ""boy, answer."" I don't know if it was her uncle or her dad, since they both called me ""boy."" I left it on read and stopped bothering her. I thought it was all over.


On Wednesday, I was in bed and suddenly I heard a knock on the door, and when I opened it, it was my ex saying he wanted to talk to me. I told her I didn't need to talk to her. She started crying, and I told her to come in. I just let her in to get a little more information.


She started off by saying she slept with José because she was scared. I told her to stop lying. She didn't sleep with me out of fear. She told me she did it out of spite to see if she could forget me, but during the time they were doing it, she was thinking about me. She tried to manipulate me by saying that I had a bigger one, that I knew how to move, etc., but I told her that I didn't care who was better in that regard. I asked her who knew that she slept with José, and to my surprise, all our mutual friends knew.


I asked her what day she slept with José. She was a little hesitant, but she said it was the first week, Thursday to be exact. I didn't want to continue with this anymore, but she told me she regretted it while they were doing it, that she loved me, and that it would get better for both of us. At that moment, I interrupted her, saying that if she wanted to improve, she should improve for herself, not for me because I didn't see a future with her. At that moment, she started crying. I told her that when she finished calming down, she could leave. She calmed down a short time later. She tried to kiss me, but I pulled away.


I told her I didn't want to hear about her or José like that anymore. Now I'm trying to distract myself by doing several things. I'm thinking about signing up for swimming. I decided to focus on my studies. Also, as an extra hobby, I decide to go for walks in the early morning. I feel like things are going to get better.

"I broke up with my boyfriend because he called my best friend a predator TL;DR: boyfriend doesn't want to meet my best friend and calls him a predator. Verbal abuse and aggressive behavior towards me. I break up and want to leave, he asks to be roommates because he can't afford rent on his own.  
  
I (F24, Italy) and my boyfriend (M25, US) live in Switzerland. He moved to my place last November, because we were having a good relationship and it's a way to save money with the crazy renting cost in this city.

I have a dear best friend from my hometown, we basically grew up together since we are the same age, were neighbors and our parents had a good relation. We went through primary, middle and high school in the same classroom and always hung out together during university. After I moved abroad, we still kept in touch by texting and we saw each other every time I went back to visit my family.

*^(This has nothing to do with the current issue, but I still think it needs to be said: we NEVER had any kind of romantic or sexual feelings for each other; every partner we had always understood this.)*

So, last month my friend told me he was taking a trip to France with his girlfriend. Since I live in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, we decided that they should definitely stop here for a couple of days on their way back to Italy. I was really happy to see him and his girlfriend again, and my boyfriend was also glad to finally meet this guy.

Two days ago they left for France, and my boyfriend asked some basic questions to already know them better before meeting. He got curious on how long they've been together, and I said 5 years.  
""Oh, so they met in college?"" I said no, she was in high school. He got very cold and asked how old was she. I said 17, why?  
He started to freak out. Asking if he ever did anything weird or creepy to me. I got quite upset at that, because this friend is one of the persons I trust the most in the world. Then my boyfriend started raising his voice, yelling that my friend is a predator, a pedophile. I'm like, what? I tried to explain that not only is the age of consent in Italy 14, but it's totally normal to see high school students having a relationship with 18, 19, even pushing to 20 year olds. Of course the majority of relationships happens between students around the same age, but still, it's normal. But he wouldn't have any of it, mumbling stuff like ""these fucking r-word societies"". At that point I got really annoyed and said that we treat teenagers as people capable to have basic responsibilities, make their own choices in order to learn and enjoy life, not as stupid children who need constant protection and repression. When I was 16 I also had a FWB thing with an 18 years old for a few months.

Anyway, he said that he's not going to meet my friend because he feels disgusted. I said that he's a very important person in my life, so I don't want to stay in a relationship in which there's going to be so much tension with my best friend and hostility towards him. He said ""Whatever, I don't fucking care"" and left.  
I needed a backup plan, so I immediately contacted a friend living in here, because she's going abroad until the end of the year and is looking to sublet; she said that if I confirm, I can already move my stuff in there this weekend and sleep on the couch until she leaves on the 12th.

When my (ex) boyfriend came back he kept insulting both my friend and me again and started knocking stuff from the table and the furniture (nothing broke, even though my headphones were some of the things that fell on the floor). At that point I told him that we're done and that I already found another place. I'm obviously paying half the rent for May, since my name is still on the contract. He said I cannot do this to him, that there's no away he can afford paying the rent on his own and that finding a new apartment takes a long time and is a very difficult process (true). So I told him I can stay here (I can afford it), but he needs to move out ASAP, he can find a cheap sublet or a friend's couch for the time it takes him to find another place. He said no, that it would be ""degrading"", so I said that I'm going away, not my problem.

Now he says that I'm overreacting (he's the one that kept yelling and that showed an aggressive behavior), that we can be roommates until he finds a place, promising that he's going to keep his distance and limiting the interactions to a minimum. I'm slightly inclined to trust him, after all it's the first time he acted this aggressively with me. But part of me is saying ""don't risk it""; plus, I wouldn't be able to hang out with my friend and his girlfriend in a calm place.",offmychest,mixed,28
"I got cold feet at a brothel the last second and I do not regret it I think that a lot of young men like me (20M) browse through these Subreddits. Young men who haven't had sex yet and wish to do so. If that applies to you and you're considering to take a shortcut, please listen to my story. 

Just a few hours ago, I was a stuttering mess. I politely declined her advances, let her keep the money, and left peacefully. I did not do the deed, I did not. And looking back at it: it was the right decision. But please let me elaborate. 

Before I booked that appointment and went to the location, I had this feeling that it was ""high-time"" I did this. I wanted to ""be a man"" and imagined myself much happier after the entire endeavor, finally reaching that status that I could flaunt. I figured that other people did it and turned out fine, so why couldn't I do it? Well, those are the thoughts that led to me booking it all. 

I even jokingly went to the chapel and prayed, asking that nobody shall catch me and that I can simply get away with it. Currently, a lot of people I know are not in town right now. I deliberately waited until this moment, knowing it'll make things easier. I prepared a route and a time, I really did my homework. 

And then there I was, thirsty in the room. It was then and there that I looked in the mirror and saw myself: a young man who was about to commit a mistake. In that moment, a phrase came to mind: ""The process is just as important as the result."" 

From there, it dawned on me. I didn't want this. I didn't need this. It doesn't define me as a ""a man"". I do not need to do this. I shouldn't. I don't want to face the people I love knowing that I paid for such a thing. How did I ever think I needed to be here to prove anything? It's bullshit. It's not who I am and what I do. It's fine. 

So I ended up drinking some water and asking to leave, as I stuttered a lot. And I ended up doing just that. 

And you know what? I do not regret it, one bit. I just knew that if I had pulled through, I would have deeply resented myself.

Instead, I went to a restaurant and bought a burger. It was a really tasty burger. It had a familiar taste that brought me back down to earth. And now, I just feel . . . .  a bit bad. I feel bad for ever considering it at all. I don't have to. This is not my way. And adding onto this: I can't tell you when I will get intimate. And that is fine. All I can ask you to read through this story, if you are in a similar place, and listen to me: you are not any less of a man because you haven't had sex yet. You are more than that. Never let anyone or anything pressure you, not even yourself. 

Right now, I am just glad to be at home. I am writing this, despite feeling uneasy about the whole thing. I just hope that the Father saw me avert the deed before it was sealed. I just hope that I can take this experience and turn it into a catalyst for self-growth and development. And I hope that whoever is reading this can learn from my mistakes and avert the process entirely.",offmychest,mixed,26
"At thirty I'm coming to terms with never seeing my father again In a few weeks I'll be thirty. During this time each year I fear the sadness anticipated on my birthday. Each year I have one secret wish—I wish my father would call.

My memories of him has started to fade. He used to be an Englishman in a foreign city. Clean-shaven with Doc Martens. Listening to reggae and Ian Dury. Smoking cigarettes and talking about art. Painting, reading and discussing politics and West Ham. Nowadays I'm not even sure I'd recognize him. It's only in the mirror where I can make out his face.

The last I heard was that he left the city fifteen years ago. Three years earlier he promised me that he'd meet me at a certain spot at a certain time the day after. I sat there alone for three hours. I was twelve and my mother had just met another man, the man who I now introduce as my father. For three more years he lived here, and then the he left and is nowhere to be found. No online presence, no relatives I can speak with, nothing.

My whole life I've been chasing my idea of his acceptance. I studied art, books became my primary hobby, my record collection is from what I can remember of him. Everything I've done, all my achievements and my goals, everything has been in an attempt to please him. But he's never been aware of it.

For my twentieth birthday I made a promise to myself—if I hadn't heard anything in ten years I would leave the memories behind. I'm getting married in a year. We're discussing children. He won't be a part of their lives. I'm just now accepting this.",offmychest,mixed,13

It was a notepad file but when I opened it, it read like a journal or a manifesto. It’s too explicit to post here in full, but to keep it short: he’s been cheating on my mom since I was in high school. Not just once but weekly. New women, over and over.
ALOT of which I recognize.. 

My mom has a Reddit account, so I’m posting this from a throwaway. I just don’t know what to do. The file talked about how he’s been with dozens of women since his early 20s, but he always told me my mom was his first. That part was already bad enough; but then I read more. Stuff about how he enjoyed hurting girls emotionally. Said he’d do it just to watch their reactions. He was proud of it.
Now I feel like my whole life has been a lie. I don’t know if I should tell my mom or just pretend I never saw it. There’s more in that journal, a lot more. It honestly scared me. I cant post the full excerpt note here as theres some personal information and is too explicit for this sub. But if anyones curious I can post it on a google doc once its scrubbed of identifying details like names, locations, etc.

UPDATE POST !!!

For those of you wondering, I took the advice this morning and told my mom all about it. She's a mess right now but I'm helping her packup some stuff because she doesnt believe she's safe living with my dad anymore. 

And for clarification, I don't believe it was fictional/fantasy because the details are too specific and the time gaps actually line up to our real lifeso I don't think its just smut he wrote.

And I've got some messages about the note, and I'll try making a google doc of it later on today if I'm not too busy.
And I'll probably have to scrub off a lot so I doubt I can post it in full, as I'm not sure about this subreddits policies but there is a lot of homophobia, racism, and misogynistic remarks..

Thank you guys for your advice, I'll give an update once this all clears out. And yes, my mom's making an appointment to get checked for any STI's.

"My wife threatened to kill me while she was drunk We were together at an event, where vendors and customers find each other to hopefully create new business.

After a long day and after dinner, a group decided to go to a party. Most people of the group were not sober anymore.

It was a mix of people from the event and other clients who were staying in that hotel.

At a certain moment, I (male) was going to get a drink and a lady from one of the suppliers started talking to me and offered me a drink.  
My wife came to me to interfere. Later another lady was talking to me (also from the event) and this was also not to the liking of my wife.

Back at the hotel room where the ambiance was already dark, she started about why I was talking to ladies, and why I didn't talk to her and I said that they were the vendors from the event. I even said to the ladies from the vendors that my wife was standing there so if they wanted to hit on me, they knew that I have a wife already. I also explained this to my wife but it was not enough.  
This all escalated and she was hitting me, scratching me, and saying that she was going to kill me.

I was getting my stuff and wanted to walk away. She stopped me and we were pushing and pulling, She started to cry and apologize.

It was in the middle of the night so we cooled down and slept in the end. The next day she apologized again. The fact that she hits me and threatened to kill me wories me. Also because I know that she has connections from the past. People from other countries that kill without losing a night of sleep.

today, i voiced out a frustration. i can’t get a root canal treatment done and see my psychologist at the same time because i simply can’t afford it. it’s one or the other. and she offered to pay, said take it one step at a time and it’ll all work out in the end.

which sounds so nice now - but at the time, i was frustrated and told her she has the ability to say things like that because she has never had to worry about having food on the table and that she has never lived through the daily burden of simply just existing. 

she brings me to fancy restaurants all the time and pays for all of our holidays when i’ve made it really clear that one trip a year, with the budget of a backpacker, is all i can afford. we’ve fought over me refusing expensive things from her on random times. she bought me a macbook one time when my old one was working perfectly fine.

i know what i sound like. it’s ungrateful. i just can’t explain how i’m feeling. it’s like…i’m studying and working everyday so i can have the means to live a somewhat decent life…while she was born with it? it’s not her fault, i know. it’s just sometimes, i don’t think she even remembers that i grew up dirt poor in a third world country. 

i’m not built for luxury. the financial inequality must be so frustrating for her even. i’m sure she would love to be with someone who can afford everything she deserves. 

edit: i will be talking to her about all of my feelings and everything i have said in this post. 

however, some of you are unbelievably just horrible and clearly grew up privileged too. i can’t believe i have to explain that there is a difference between being poor in a developed country and being poor in a third world country. 

my dad was hardworking enough to put himself through a trade school which gave us the opportunity to uproot ourselves away from poverty.  to be able to leave, we leased our souls to very rich people in my country. we are still paying it back to this day.

my ma cleans the toilets you people shit in and my dad fixes your cars. i’ve seen them get belittled. i’ve seen my siblings with wounds all over their feet because we couldn’t afford shoes. 

so forgive me if i’m being ungrateful when my girlfriend flaunts me her generational wealth without asking for anything in return. from my point of view, i see my mother scrubbing clothes tucked in a wet and dark room all day for $4. i see my dad coming home with rice, salt and soy sauce with cuts and dirt all over his hands. and it makes me think, what have i done to deserve this? what have i worked for? 

i’m glad none of you had to go through that, but please do not invalidate how i feel when you’ve never been in my shoes. thank you.

edit 2: she has seen all of this post and all of your comments. i’m looking into her being able to come into one of my therapy sessions so we can work through this together. it’s tmi, but the sessions are mainly for the things i had to go through when i was a child. so this’ll be a completely different level for me, with her being in the room. 

for all of you saying that she should leave me, she says she’ll politely decline your “strange internet request”. we have been in each other’s lives for awhile and she plans on staying with me for the rest of it. thanks everyone. :)",offmychest,mixed,1814

"I’m starting to hate the idea of romantic love Lately, I(28F) feel like I’ve stopped believing in romantic love. The expectations I once had about being in love have slowly crumbled. What I used to think was love now feels like a fantasy. Every time I see romance in a series or film, it seems to portray something unreal, something that doesn’t exist in real life. It hurts to admit, but all the ideas I had about love are fading away, both in my own life and in the lives of those around me.

I see a world without commitment, without loyalty. No one seems willing to make sacrifices anymore. Cheaters are everywhere. And I live with a constant fear of being betrayed. I’ve begun to accept breadcrumbs and mistreatment from my partner, maybe because deep down I doubt whether I truly deserve a noble, deep, and intense love.

Even the love my parents once shared—which for years was my biggest example—seems to be fading. They, too, look lost. And I feel adrift, walking through uncertain, unstable, dangerous ground. I don’t want to love anyone again. Love has hurt me. I’m afraid to invest in someone who might, after years, regret being with me, feel ashamed of me, hide me, ignore me, and treat me without care or affection.

I feel defeated. And I don’t know how to channel all this energy into self love, how to fully give up on the idea of romantic love without feeling like I’m losing something essential.",offmychest,mixed,68

Just this afternoon, there was this guy in a car who waved at me while he was smiling creepily, and when I was near home, he's driving on the opposite direction again, he literally stopped his car in front of me and saying stuff but since I was wearing my earphones playing music on max volume, I couldn't hear him but it made me so uncomfortable. 

This happens so many times, some would honk at me, some would drive slow and say stuff, some would shout.

"I’m a 20-year-old gay boy from Swat, Pakistan – I feel so alone Hi everyone,  
I’m writing this with a heavy heart. I’m a 20-year-old boy from Swat, KPK, from a traditional Pashtun family. I’ve always known I’m gay — I’ve never been attracted to girls, and I deeply admire older men, especially those between 30–35 years of age. But in a society like mine, I can never express this safely.

There’s someone I really like — he’s married and straight, and he doesn’t know anything about how I feel. It hurts so much. I keep asking Allah why He made me like this. I feel stuck between my faith, my culture, and my heart. I cry silently at night and don’t know who to talk to.

I don’t want to do anything wrong, I just want peace inside my heart and someone to talk to who understands.  
Please, if anyone else here is from Pakistan or KPK and can relate — even just to say “you’re not alone” — it would mean the world to me.

"I need some sense knocked into me My bf’s (pretty sure he was going to propose soon) IG algorithm shows nothing but half naked women with giant tits posing sexually, making videos of themselves being provocative, etc. I find that disgusting - it’s always been a huge red flag for me. I don’t do it, I don’t like when my partner does it. And he’s liking all these posts obviously, hence it his newsfeed/FYP comprising of 99% of that. Well, last night I saw he had recently “liked” a video of some half naked woman (again) saying “rejecting a girl because you have a girlfriend is like rejecting money because you have a job. Real men don’t limit themselves.” I nearly puked. I’ve felt sick ever since. He obviously had no idea I’d ever see any of it. 

Call me stupid, but he cheated on his ex wife. It was one of the first things he told me when he met, and I decided to see how things went and whether or not I’m seeing the changes in himself that he swore he had made. I have a cordial relationship with his ex wife who told me she genuinely hopes he truly has changed for my sake and his. I saw enough changes that I decided to give him a chance, but truthfully it’s subconsciously been a fear and insecurity of mine. But everything else seemed and felt so genuine, including him learning from his infidelity. 

I feel so hollow. I have had my heart destroyed, and after a lot of therapy and work on myself, I met him and we fell in love and I truly believed he was “it.” 

I know what to do. I don’t know what to do. I’m glad I saw it, I really am. But I’m feeling so much hatred and animosity toward him right now. He lied. And I’m just disgusted by him. I wish this was a nightmare.

"I kept a dumpster-dived headless life-sized hyperrealistic silicone sex doll for 2.5 years In 2020, my friend posted an Instagram story saying he’d thought there was a dead human body in his apartment complex’s dumpster, but upon closer inspection, it was just a hyperrealistic life-sized silicone sex doll with no head. 

I asked if I could come pick her up. Obviously I had no plans to have sex with the doll, I just felt bad for it. With the help of said friend and my fiancé at the time, we loaded her into my other friend’s truck and drove her back to my fiancé’s and my apartment. I was also an art student at the time, so I made a video art project out of cleaning her (she had clearly been dragged across gravel and was covered in dirt). She was 150 pounds, and I was 130ish pounds at the time and my then-fiancé weighed even less, so transporting her up 4 flights of stairs was rough, but we managed. Also I should note I was 21 when this occurred. My fiancé was a few years older. 

I named her Priscilla and we set her up in our bedroom after putting her in clothes. I wanted to add a head to her, but the female mannequin heads I found were proportionally way too small for her body.

When I broke up with my ex, he (very reasonably) demanded that I get rid of Priscilla so he didn’t have to deal with her, and so my older siblings and I wrestled her into a trash bag and threw her out. I had to move back in with my parents post-breakup, and I wasn’t ready to explain to them why I had a life-sized headless silicone sex doll in my luggage.

I am not a superstitious person and I don’t believe inanimate objects have souls or anything, but it kind of broke my heart to throw her into the trash, in the same way it broke my heart to have to throw away stuffed animals when I was a kid. It’s weird. It’s been a couple years since then and I recently saw a tweet from our local police scanner follower that someone thought they saw a body but it was actually a headless sex doll, and I wonder if it was Priscilla.

"I was touched by a woman for the first time in a year and it was the coworker I don't like. I feel disgusted with myself. *Preamble: Yeah I never made this reddit account to be serious, but here I am.*

For background I'm a forty year old white guy working part time third shift at a chain gas station/convenience store so I can put something in my savings account. There's one coworker that covers one of my nights off and she's pretty useless. We'll call her M. I'm constantly catching up on cleaning and stocking left from the night before. I could do a whole rant about the coffee machines....

So last night I'm clocking in when M is supposed to be wrapping up second shift. Instead she's got nothing done and now we're gonna be stuck doing shift change for thirty minutes. M is the only coworker I have this issue with.

Finally we got the cash & coin counted, dropped, and documented. There's still some food to write off, but I tell her I'll get it later and she can leave. M picks out stuff from the shelves, checks out like normal  and then clocks out in the office.

I'm just starting a transaction with a customer when M passes behind me and stops. M runs her hand up and down my back four times, then says ""you smell nice tonight"", before she scratches my several times all while I'm transacting with a customer. 

Between scanning the items while she's scratching and taking payment I put my hands flat on the counter. That's when M leaves and I stayed that way until I heard the door chime.

I finished the transaction once I knew she was gone.

The customer left and I stood there.

Who the fuck is this chick? Why the fuck is she touching me?

Why the fuck does she care what I smell like? It's the same body spray I douse myself in every night to cover the weed smell.

Like what the fuck? We all watch the same damn videos at orientation and even before those I knew you don't touch coworkers without permission. I would go out of my way to avoid physical contact just so other people wouldn't be uncomfortable.

Who the fuck thinks this kind of shit is okay?

And keep in mind I'm a forty year old white guy. If I did this to one of my coworkers I'd be fired, possibly face legal charges, and one of their husbands or boyfriends would show up to kick my ass.

Meanwhile I go out of my way to be chill, polite, and helpful at work. I know the public we deal with is often shitty and try to be the opposite. Be the change you want to see, right? 

But somehow this chick thinks she can be so fucking bold?

Like I'm some fucking animal at a petting zoo.

The sheer fucking hubris of this chick solidified could hold the orbit of a moon with it's gravitational pull.

I'm so mad.

I wish I told M to fuck off when it was happening but I was too focused on the work.

I wish I slapped the teeth out of her mouth for touching me like that.

Instead I just kept working because it's all my brain knew how to do at the time. 

But I did report it to the assistant and general managers respectively. It's probably all I can do at this point.",offmychest,mixed,9

I have made my mind up. Please do not send empathy or sympathy. I deserve to be selfish for once in my life.

"My dog is going to die and I don’t know how to cope My precious dog, a female 13 years old westie, is suddenly falling apart. Her legs are unstable and she has tumor in her lungs, probably cancer. She isn’t going to live for long. This literally broke my heart. I’m 22M and I have her since I was 9 years old. She saved my life. 

I had her by my side during my childhood, my teenage years and my early adult life. We grow up together. I don’t have any sibling and I grew up in a really toxic and emotionally abusive and neglectful family. When I was a kid or a teen and I used to come back home feeling upset about something that happened at school, only my dog was there for me to comfort me. Even currently as an adult, when I have personal problems, the first one to be there for me with a cuddle is her. When I broke up with my ex gf and I was devastated, I used to go for walks with her and calm down. When I used to come home after a bad shift at work, she was there to show me that someone can love me no matter what. 

Hearing from vets that she isn’t going to live longer than two months is the most heartbreaking experience in my life. I don’t think I would be where I am today if I didn’t receive this kind of love from my beloved dog. I don’t know how I’m going to be mentally well if I see her passing away and live my life knowing I won’t be able to cuddle her again. To go for a walk with her. To spoil her with treats and toys. To see her doing silly stuff and laugh. To feel like there is someone that loves me unconditionally, no matter how many mistakes I made. No matter how problematic I am. I can’t imagine a life after I burry her and see her for the last time. The thought of it makes my heart break and my future seem dark and scary. Seeing her being old and weak is the most painful thing I’ve ever witnessed. The past one week after she got diagnosed, I can’t stop crying. I can’t sleep. I can’t focus on my college. I have so many important tasks for college since it’s my last month and I can’t do any of it. My life is falling apart.

"Ready to admit to my ""Father Issues"" How do you deal with it? How do you handle situations that a father figure would know the answers to? I feel the absence almost 24/7, and it mentally hurts me, it really does. I feel as if it's also destroying my life. I go out and see little girls with their present fathers.. and I stare in awe, I wish I had that. Maybe if I did have that, I wouldn't be as messed up as I am now. 

Destroying my life how? You may ask. I haven't been in a relationship in about 4 years now. I have had potential partners.. or talking stages you may say. They were all wonderful guys and I feel terrible for making up some BS excuse to not take it further with them. When in reality.. they just weren't old enough.. they weren't mature enough.. I want a man. I have typically only started looking for older men. Men twice my age. Men that wouldn't mind having me as their controversially young girlfriend. Why? Because deep down I feel like they could help with my daddy issues.. it's a very embarrassing thing to admit. Looking for a father figure in a spouse. Looking for some guidance in my life.. some direction, someone to teach me things that only a father figure would be good at. To prevent myself from making any destructive decisions or to avoid being ""taken advantage of"", I just resort to reading books, that have a strong or prominent father figure.. and I just imagine I had that. Or ill listen to different ASMR audios for the same reason. I also never thought I'd be saying this on a forum.. but, I need to tell someone instead of keeping this all in. It's suffocating. I type this with watery eyes, because of how stupid I feel just trying to confess.

Sometimes I just need.. dad. I don't know how else to explain it. My father was partially in my life, but he wasn't present. I would only see him on weekends. I was always given a ""hush"" gift. I'd try to make conversation or connect with him and he would just give me short worded answers and give me something to make me leave him alone. I caught on to this in my early teenage years. I am now 24, and the oldest of my 3 other siblings. My father wasn't emotionally present for me.. but for my baby sister who is 3 now, he is extremely active in her life. Him flaunting taking her on occasional ""daddy/daughter dates"" on his facebook.. taking her trick or treating.. ""teaching"" her how to use his different lawn equipment.. And I have actually cried about this. Seeing all these pictures of my father pop up on my facebook timeline, of something I should have had.. but didn't. I shouldn't be jealous, but I am. I am happy for her, and that she's able to experience what I didn't get to.. but I needed that too. This is probably all over the place, but I'm just venting and typing what I feel. ""See a therapist"".. is what Im going to anticipate most people would say. But not everyone can afford it, and Im afraid that therapy just can't fix this.",offmychest,mixed,3

"My Gf of 2 years is leaving for college, and it sucks Like the title states, my gf (18F) of 2 almost 3 years is leaving for MSU after this summer, I (18M) am sticking in my home town because I can’t afford to leave the state for schooling. I CAN however afford to do one of the more affordable schools or community college within an hour drive of MSU and suggested this, because it’s the healthiest and longest relationship of my life (go figure, I’m only 18). Her reaction to this was very hesitant and said that it wasn’t a good idea. When I asked why, she said that I shouldn’t uproot my life to be with her. I understand that, but she also knows that I date to marry and I wouldn’t have been with her this long had I been just dating around, so she’s BECOME a major part of my life so I’m committed to doing something like that.

For awhile we had said that we’d be able to do long distance for maybe a year or two to save up some money, then I could transfer over and graduate (I’d have no struggle to transfer, my academics were plenty to get in). And I was stress about long distance, but ready to make it work.

Over the last couple months, she’s been starting more arguments, accidentally told me that she had been hanging out with a girl shed been crushing on (she’s Bi), saying that I’ve been very problematic recently, etc. 

Last night I spoke to her about this, and asked if there was something that was bothering her and she got defensive and said that I’m bringing this up to make her feel bad, and to say everything she had done wrong, and that she’s apparently always 
mad at me. 

I had been avoiding the college conversation for a long time because it’s a hard one to bring up. But I brought it up, and said that this kind of conflict isn’t healthy for either of us, and that when she goes to MSU, for both of our sake we might want to stop being together. She said we should stay together for at least the summer, and I agreed.

She got teary eyed, but she started smiling big within the minute (keep in mind this was after three hours of me trying to work through a different argument). She gave me a hug and said she thought so too.

I hated it. It sucked. I would chase this girl to the ends of the earth. I get along with her family so well, and her brother, and she’s shown me ways that I could be treated that no one has ever shown me before.

I am and I was ready to go anywhere on the globe to stay with her. But I know unhealthy habits when I see them, I know it would make it extremely difficult, with years of education ahead of us, I know it probably wouldn’t work. 

But I’m still ready to do that, if she just says the word I’d make it work, I’d make ends meet.

She got so happy about what I said last night, suddenly all her other arguments she had with me were gone, and she told me “this doesn’t change anything, it’s Ok”. I gave her a hug and left, that was the most painful thing I’ve ever done. 

I’m convinced she had known she was going to do this for a long time coming, and that she had mentally checked out months ago because of it, which makes me a little spiteful. If she had told me before, I wouldn’t have let it go on this long, and it would have been easier to process earlier in the relationship. I’m hurt. 

Anyway this was kind of me just spilling, so if you got this far, thanks for reading. I’m not really looking for advice on Reddit, I kind of just wanted to get this off my chest.",offmychest,mixed,2
"Friends with benefits, but I want more – and she wants to date others. What should I do? I’ve been seeing this girl on and off since early March. Things started pretty intense – we went on multiple dates, spent the night together, cooked, talked for hours, and had a great connection both emotionally and physically. I really liked her.

But after a few weeks, she told me she wasn’t looking for a relationship and felt that I wanted more than she could offer. She said we were just in different places. We had a long phone call (over an hour) where she said it would only end with one of us getting hurt. After that, we stopped seeing each other, and I tried to move on.

After a few weeks of no contact, I eventually sent her a message. She didn’t reply for an entire week – and I assumed it was over for good. But then she responded, and we ended up seeing each other again. That night led to us sleeping together, and since then, we’ve spent time together again: painting, walking, being intimate, and genuinely having a great vibe.

The thing is: she’s now very clear that she only wants us to be **friends with benefits** – and that she wants the freedom to **date other people**. At the same time, she said she wouldn’t be comfortable if **I** dated someone else. That’s been hard for me to wrap my head around.

It honestly feels like she might be trying to make me jealous – or maybe trying to keep emotional distance while still having me around. But I can’t tell if this is a defense mechanism or if she really sees no future between us. I agreed to the FWB setup… but I did it mostly out of hope – hoping that if I stayed close, she might eventually come around and feel the same way I do.

It’s confusing, because sometimes she’ll go long periods without replying to my texts – yet when she finally does, her messages are sweet, kind, even flirtatious. We’ve also had two long phone calls (over an hour each) – one when she broke things off initially, and one after the break when she texted me again and I asked her to call me. That call was warm, even a bit intimate.

I’ve tried to play it cool, act like I’m fine with the setup, but the truth is – I’m not. I can’t keep sleeping with someone I have feelings for while they’re potentially dating other people. It makes me anxious, insecure, and unsure of where I stand.

So my question is:  
**What should I do now?**  
Should I be honest and set a boundary that I can’t continue like this? Or should I just back away and give her space to figure things out? Is there any chance she feels more than she’s letting on – or am I just fooling myself by hoping?

Any advice would be genuinely appreciated. I'm stuck between wanting to protect myself and not wanting to lose her.",offmychest,mixed,4

I’ve always had the feeling that people love me as a friend. I’m the fun, supportive, kind person they enjoy spending time with. I make people laugh, I listen, I care. But when it comes to love, it’s like I become invisible. No one ever seems to want me in that way.

What hurts the most is that I’m so ready to love someone deeply. I want to give everything, my heart, my time, my energy. But it feels like no one ever sees me as more than the “fun friend.” I keep ending up in this space where I’m appreciated, but never chosen.

I know someone has fallen for me before, but I couldn’t love them back and that just adds to the sadness. It’s like love is always slightly out of reach. Either I love someone who doesn’t love me back, or someone loves me and I don’t feel the same.",offmychest,mixed,13
"Well… not sure. Alcoholic and struggling I don’t really know how to start this. I’ve been drinking tonight — cherry Coke and vodka, if it matters — and it’s one of those nights where the silence feels louder than anything.

I’m struggling. I’m jobless, stuck in a toxic home situation, and I feel completely alone most of the time. I’ve got one real friend — Dan — but even that’s complicated in ways I won’t get into right now. I care about him, maybe more than I should, and that just adds to the mess in my head.

I talked with GPT for hours tonight, just trying to feel seen. They told me to try Reddit. So here I am.

I don’t want sympathy or advice, really — I just want to know if someone out there feels this too. If anyone else is just… tired. Lonely. Drinking not to party but to forget.

I’m not looking for a miracle. Just a reply. Just a little proof I’m not invisible.

Thanks for reading this, whoever you are.",offmychest,mixed,2
"My heart is hurting Throw away bc my main has my face and I don’t need anyone I know finding this. 

I (36f) moved to the west coast from the east coast 6 years ago to turn my life around and I am currently visiting my hometown and family and friends. I haven’t seen most of them in about 2 years and in these past 2 years I have grown the most emotionally, mentally, spiritually and experiencing all of this has been a roller coaster. 

In recovery they preach to change people, places and things and that’s exactly what I did to become the healthy human I am today. Coming back to these people, places and things as this new person has me full of gratitude and also full of heartbreak. 

I have a massive family and we all walk different paths on this earth and some are rougher than others. Witnessing my cousin fail his two children is what got me here tonight. 

I understand we all have our own demons and battles. I don’t have children so I will never know what it’s like to be a parent and that being said no child should have to live in filth. I couldn’t even breathe when I walked into that house, I could smell the stench just approaching the house and tried to abort mission but I had no way out. I didn’t breathe for the whole 3 minutes I was inside before I asked to go see the backyard. There are two children (the gf’s kids) under 5 and my cousins girlfriend is pregnant. This can’t be healthy for any of them or the unborn baby. 

The other 2 children are MS and HS aged and the younger one confided in me that she doesn’t want to live there anymore but there’s no where else for her to go and it shattered me. I’ve seen this baby girl grow up and she’s so beautiful, kind and sweet and to see her be neglected, just makes me want to pop off on my cousin but then I would lose access to his children and I want them to know that I will be there for them the best I can. 

I’m glad I don’t live here bc then I would be too involved and destroy all the progress I have made on myself bc I might not have kids but I love kids. They just need love, support and attention and they aren’t getting any of that. Ugh my whole heart is just breaking over here. 

Thank you for reading if you made it this far. Sending love to anyone reading this that is struggling, feels stuck or hopeless. I promise there is a light in that darkness, may it find you 🫶🏽",offmychest,mixed,35
"I think I belong with him Today I visited the grave of my ex for the first time. He would have been 50 today. He died 5 years ago of a drug related heart attack. I hadn’t seen him for about 10 years before he died. 

Our relationship was not great. But he was my first love. I was 16 when we met. He was 24. We got together right after my 18th birthday. We were together for 10 years before I found the courage to leave. 

He was beautiful and sad and so in need of love and also mean and hateful. I know that I would have lived a better life if I’d never met him. But I did. And he was my whole world for a long time. I know that I did the right thing by leaving him. 

I hadn’t seen him for a decade when I heard that he had died. He spiraled after I forced him out of my life. The alcohol was always a problem. But the drugs became a more predominant problem. 

He died of a drug related heart attack about 5 years ago. He would have turned 50 today. I thought that visiting his grave would be cathartic in some way. But now I’m just so sad. 

The cemetery didn’t even have a record for him. I found his grave by searching for his mother. And even that wasn’t located where the records showed it. His stone doesn’t have his full name, just his last name. There’s no dates. There’s no epitaph. How sad is that?

It was really obvious that nobody has been there since the stone was placed. How sad is that?  I think that he was the love of my life. It was bad. It was dark. It was abusive. But it was also really deep. I’ve never had a love like that since. I know that it wasn’t healthy. But it was true. And it makes me so sad that he was so disposable to anyone else, even his family. 

I’m so fucking sad for him. Because as flawed as he was, he was doomed from the start. He was set up to fail. His drug addict mother died the same way that he did, in front of him, when he was a teen. And she demanded that he not call 911 until she was dead. So he did what she asked. And she died instead of going to prison. 

He always told me that he was going to die like his mother. And he did. And he’s just this sad footnote now. I don’t even think his family wants to remember him. But he haunts my dreams. 

I’m so sad today",offmychest,mixed,2
"watching all the people who treated you like crap during high school starting luxury business, becoming doctors, getting engaged, reaching success. If you asked me in person I would say, ""I am really happy for them and wish them the best"" but if I'm really being honest with myself, it really breaks me that these people who unapologetically bullied and spread rumors about me and many others during high school just have their way with life. Best of all they don't even remember the people they bullied. I don't wish them any harm even after all that but it still just hurts.

"The moment I realized i was a ""nice guy"" I don't mean ""nice guy"" in either a good or bad way, just a statement of one's self.

I went through a journey finding my niche in the dating scene, definitely was very naive and clueless for a long time. Got more self confidence in my late 20s, along with doing a lot better financially, and things started getting a lot easier for me.

I met this girl who was super into me from the getgo, and I noticed she would sort of perk up whenever would act in any way mean or rude to her (in a joking way). I remember she'd come over for Netflix and chill and after like 10-15 she'd just hop onto her knees and start blowing me (god i miss that). One time as sort of a test as she was unzipping me I said something dumb like ""yeah you'd better suck it good, or else...""

And her eyes just lit up. She responded ""Or else what?"" in the most hopeful way, and at that moment i figured if I just embraced the dark side I could really get this girl on the hook. But I couldn't do it, not even pretending just once. I would just have so much guilt about it. A few weeks after that she ghosted me and I never saw her again.

I think about that moment a lot, but I don't really have any regrets. I probably spent too much of my life pedestalizing women, but it's who I am at this point.",offmychest,mixed,2

"My fiancée cheated. I found the guy, told his girlfriend, and watched it all burn. Then I wrote a song for the day our daughter asks what happened. I’ve held this in for way too long.

A few months ago, my fiancée started acting off. Weird energy. Cold, distracted, secretive. I knew something was wrong. So yeah, I went through her stuff and found proof: she was cheating.

It destroyed me. We have a house. A child. A life we were building. And the worst part? She was always pressing me to prove my loyalty and making me feel like I wasn’t doing enough… while she was the one being disloyal behind my back.

But I didn’t just sit with it. I found the other guy’s info. Dug through what I could until I figured out who his girlfriend was. I found her info and told her everything.

She confronted him. He confessed. And just like that, he messaged my fiancée one last time and completely cut ties. She has no idea it was me who blew it up.

For a while, I was full of rage. Betrayed. Grieving. But knowing she lost him too — and never knew why — gave me peace. That was the moment I stopped begging for clarity and started choosing myself.

We’re separating now. Co-parenting. Untangling years of love, lies, and damage.

One day, our daughter will ask what happened between her parents. Why we didn’t make it. And I’ll have to explain that the person I trusted most broke that trust.

So I wrote a song. It’s not perfect, but it’s real. It’s what I’d want my daughter to hear someday — and maybe someone else out there needs to hear it too.

If you want to hear the song, just search “Time to Leave by Weed Sauna Dad” on YouTube. It’s raw, it’s honest, and it’s the only way I knew how to tell this story.

If it hits you, feel free to share it. I grew up on Blink-182 and Yellowcard, and I keep thinking… maybe one of them — or someone like them — will find it and bring it to life. I don’t want money. I just want the story heard.


Edit: here are the lyrics, thanks for reading. 

Time To Leave by Weed Sauna Dad 

One day she will be
Old enough to see
Who we really are
Who her parents are

For now she’s so tiny
Barely even three
The things that she has seen
No kid should ever see

And now that I know
We’re not meant to be
Now it’s time to go
Time for me to leave

One day she will ask
What happened to mom and dad?
And I won’t even try
To cover up your lies

I’ll tell her about him
You said he’s just a friend
But I know about your lies
I see through your disguise

Six years you made me
Prove my loyalty
Over and over again
Now look at how this ends

Projected onto me
Your insecurities
Over and over again
Now look at how this ends

One day she will ask
What happened to mom and dad?
Why couldn’t you make it last?
Was it really all that bad?

And I won’t try to hide
You found another guy
And how you didn’t know
I’m the reason he cut ties

And when she finally asks
What happened to mom and dad
I won’t even try
To cover up your lies

I will let her see
What you did to me
You broke the family
Then blamed it all on me

You were in therapy
But not because of me
And now I finally see
You’re not right for me

Now it’s time to go
Time for me to leave
I know everything
About you and Steve",offmychest,mixed,58
"Some of yall are not Christian Some of you are not Christian. You say you are, but will ignore passages that don’t fit your agenda. None of you love thy neighbor as much as you should. When you see your neighbor, do you wave? Do you say hi? No yall dont. You don’t love your neighbors. Half of you voted for a man who is sending people to a death camp in another country because of an alphabetical letter as a status on citizenship paperwork. You would rather see someone die than allow them to be your neighbor. You All want to talk about how being gay is bad because of the Bible yet you all will eat seafood. You All want to sit and laugh at people like Shedeur Sanders because the NFL wanted to teach a confident black man a lesson yet you all keep complaining that men are not as confident as they used to be. So men should be confident but not too confident? Jesus wouldn’t laugh Shedeur when that spoiled rich kid who never worked a day in his life pranked called him. Imagine waiting to hear back from a job and you get a call and it’s someone else on the other line that says “Put the fries in the bag lil bro”. If you said “Oh that’s horrible that worker should get hired” but laughed when it happened to Shedeur Sanders because his rich and “too confident” then you are not a Christian. 

Some of you force yourself to go to church yet will ignore everything your pastor teaches. You only go to church to gossip about people and to judge other people's fashion. You keep saying we are all children of God but in the same breath will pull a George Orwell and say that “some people are more worthy of God's love than others”. Bro, if God is real he should love me not punish me. Some of you want to act all high and mighty and preach about the Bible despite your moral shortcomings. I have moral shortcomings too but I don’t go grab a Bible and start preaching. Some of you will pull out your wallets or purse and give Joel Olsteen money because he makes you feel good. The Bible told you not to worship false prophets but Olsteen and Copeland can get all your untaxed money for private planes and isolated islands. I need a reminder, who was that one guy who also had a private plane, an isolated island, and rich friends?

"Making Friends is Frickin Impossible Ok not literally- the formula is: go up to randos you think could fit your vibe, get socials, slide up on stories, text text, hang out, and do this a few more times until everything falls off :) 

Or not really fall off, but it just never sweeps me up in a regular passionate friendship. I'm so grateful for the few true friends I have in my life, but they're home bodies. I want a friend who will spontaneously go to Buccees with me at 3 AM, pile in the car with me to take an impromptu beach trip, hiking is a planned regular thing we do. 

I haven't had a friend like that since I was 19-20. Is this just how adulthood is? :( I'm 25 now. 

I had a roomie situation and we were all friends! Ended badly. New group of roomies! Ended badly. Maybe I'm the common denominator?? 

Or maybe, I just won't put up with people who betray and talk behind my back even once. I dunno :( I think of all the things I've done for these people I loved and cared for. How many times I was told I was an amazing person and amazing friend. If that were true, then why is it that everytime I get burned. 

Then I see other people post their friend groups and they seem so super tight knit only for them to also get burned the same way! 

The formula for meeting ppl and making acquaintance-like friends is easy. It's maintaining and growing those friendships that are the hard part. :( life is just too busy for adults to have friends ig?? 


Idk I'm just rambling now. If ur also friendless like me how do u deal with it?? 

It's like a coin toss of lonely but peaceful and or chaos but social.

"MCA One of my closest friends is moving abroad soon, and I’m feeling happy-sad. How do you cope with this kind of change? This is my first time posting here and I really want to vent it out since I can’t disclose this to my other friends yet.

So I (F25) have a friend (M27). We’ve been good friends since college. Somewhere along the way, we lost touch, but we reconnected in 2023. It was really nice because we got close again and discovered that we still share the same hobbies we love doing in our free time.

Today, I asked my friend if we could hang out because I wanted to treat him for my birthday. He agreed, and we dined at a nice restaurant. While we were chatting over our meal, he suddenly dropped some big news: he got a job offer abroad and will be moving this June.

Of course, I was happy for him—it’s been one of our dreams since college, to work abroad and explore beautiful places. I really am happy for him. But at the same time, I feel incredibly sad. He’s one of the few close friends I have, and knowing he’ll be far away soon makes me feel like something in my life is about to change deeply. Like a part of me will feel incomplete when he leaves.

I’m not mad or anything, and I don’t want him to feel guilty for keeping it a secret. He told me he didn’t want to share it earlier because he didn’t want to feel pressured while going through the application process. He just wanted to wait until everything was confirmed.

I guess I’m just wondering—how do you cope with this kind of feeling? I want to support him and be happy for him, but I also feel this quiet heaviness inside.

Thank you in advance for your kind responses.

P.S. In case it matters: we’re not romantically involved. I don’t like him that way, and he doesn’t like me that way either. We’re just really good friends.",offmychest,mixed,2
"I Manipulated You to Hate Me: Truth Hidden for Almost a Decade If this confession finds its way to you, through any means available, then so too will the truth I've hidden for almost a decade. A truth I’ve carried like a second heartbeat. Perhaps it will be retold through other means, or archived through the internet.

Let me take you back—back to where it all began, when we were just kids wrapped in uniforms and naivety.

We met in high school, not through fate, but through forced proximity. Assigned seats brought us side by side, and at first, I hated it. You were loud, impulsive, too full of mischief and too quick to speak your mind. You were everything I found chaotic. And yet, I couldn't look away.

I told myself I needed to endure you, to preserve my own peace of mind. So I chose to befriend you. I laughed at your jokes, joined your pranks, and walked beside you after school as we made our way from campus to the city’s crowded transport station. We lived in the same village, so our paths intertwined more than most.

During those walks, I began to see past the tomboyish exterior. Beneath that sharp wit and unapologetic energy was someone delicate, someone tender—someone who tucked her vulnerabilities behind a mask. I began to admire the duality of you. And as we messaged more, I found myself drawn in, unsure when the lines between pretend and reality began to blur.

In our third year, something shifted. A girl entered the picture. She was confident and direct, confessing her feelings to me soon after we met. I didn’t say yes, but I also didn’t say no. I told her I wanted to get to know her first. When she started visiting our classroom to walk me home, I noticed something new in you—jealousy. You disguised it poorly behind sarcasm and snide remarks. But I saw it, and I felt it.

Then she vanished from our lives for a while, just like that. And as if in her absence, you stepped forward. We began our little “act”—pretending to be lovers for fun, or so we said. But the joke wore off quickly. Days turned into months. One day I confessed I had fallen for you. You had fallen too. We were young, not yet 18, so we made promises instead of plans. We promised to wait. I swore I would court you the moment we were of age. I would wait until we graduated college. I truly believed you would become my wife.

But then came your first hint—you were leaving, moving abroad in a few years. That single revelation cracked the foundation of everything I was building in my heart. I was torn. How could I continue loving you and building a future with you, knowing you’d be gone? That heartbreak drove me to a quiet shift, and without telling you, I began to change my path.

We entered senior high together, same university, different science specializations. You delved into the medical field, I delved into the computational field. I couldn’t help directly, but I wanted to understand you, so I immersed myself in what you loved. I learned origami, cosplay, debate, programming, even academic research. Every skill I chased, every strength I sharpened—it was all so I could worthy to stand beside you.

You made me better. And I thought we were unbreakable.

But senior high and college revealed my growing fears. I wasn’t like the others—tall, wealthy, polished. My insecurities gnawed at me. I feared you’d realize I wasn’t enough. So I did something selfish. I made a plan. One that would make you hate me.

Years ago you gave me a key to your room. You even entrusted me with your baptismal certificate, entrusting me of your future. I returned them after a year, with shaking hands. I told myself it was for your own good.

I had to become someone you’d never love again. I lost my time and attention on you. I buried myself in academics. I accepted leadership roles, joined organizations, all of which to relate to you. I befriended powerful people—children of politicians and business magnates—not out of ambition, but because I wanted to someday follow you to your new home, your new country.

But that dream of living with you on another country faded due to huge financial constraints, and so my cruel plan remained. I let other girls get close. I entertained their affections. I let you believe I cheated. I let you believe I changed in a bad way. And you started to pull away. Coldly. Quietly. Exactly what I needed, and not at all what I wanted.

Then the pandemic came, so did college. I took every scholarship exam I could. I applied to your university and passed, but my scholarship belonged elsewhere. So I studied in this state university, taking a program I never thought I’d survive—just because it was what you once talked passionately about. I wanted to understand your world, even from a distance. I wanted to fulfill the career you left. I applied scholarship courtesy of alumni of our university that are now living in the states, hoping it will bridge me closer to you, but my calculations shown that it's still better for you to hate me, for your own sake.

You turned 18, and you told me you didn’t want me anymore. I should have been crushed, but I felt relief. The plan had worked. I had protected you from the heartbreak of distance, poverty, and uncertainty. You were finally free from me.

Still, I couldn’t let go completely. Every so often, I messaged you—not to win you back, but to see if you had moved on. Your cold replies were my reassurance. You had.

Then came the last test. Months before graduation, I asked if I could fulfill the promise—to court you now that I had finished college. You declined. Final closure of my plan and my promises to you. My plan had reached its end. 

You are now a strong, independent woman. You are now living in the country you once mentioned of. You are happy with your complete family. You are now with someone new.

And you never knew the truth. You never needed to.

I never cheated, all women around me knew I am loyal to you. I only pretended to cheat on you. I never stopped loving you. Everything I did—from the crafts and skills I learned, the talents I cultivated, the hurtful words I said, the man I became—was because I love you.

The pattern of 18 you thought that was a coincidence was part of the plan all along. You began to treasure that number, as if you associate it with freedom. It was planned to always be that way.

You will always be the most profound influence in my life. I’m sorry for everything. I’m sorry I took the villain’s role in your story just to make sure you could become the heroine of your own. I had to make sure you are this unmanipulable, strong, and independent woman. 

I let people believe whatever story you tell. You can despise me freely. I accept the blame.

But know this: you were my greatest love. My greatest heartbreak. My greatest growth. Thank you for loving me.

Now, I have blocked you on all social media, as respect to your current relationship. We are now in our early 20s, I will chase the career we once dreamed about, alone. I’ll build the life I envisioned—with your memory as my compass. I am on my way to happiness, even in your absence.

You are my greatest treasure, my greatest memory, and my greatest lesson.

If fate ever brings us together again, perhaps the truth will matter then, and I'll just let fate decide what happens next.

If not, then in another life—I'd love to papercraft with you again. I hope to walk through the city beside you, laughing, young, and whole, again.

Goodbye, my moon, I am proud of what you have become. Live your life happily without me.

"I am unhappy with husband and job I (31F) am extremely unhappy with where I am in life right now. I am the breadwinner and my husband (37M) does not help much with bills or any house work. He’s so forgetful and always saying “I forgot” when it comes to any task. He forgets the recycling, he forgets to take things out of the freezer, he forgets to clean. But never forgets to smoke his weed. I am just becoming extremely resentful. Lately, work has been VERY stressful and I told my husband how I wanted to quit and stay at home for a while with our 1 year old son. Well he says “stay at home, I got us” but he does not have us. He works at a restaurant and brings home maybe $500 a weekend and I work in the tech industry and I bring home $120k. Our monthly bills are $3,000 give or take and he barely contributes. He stays home with our 1 year old but he doesn’t have him on a schedule and he sits him in front of the tv. I am so over this. I need time to think and as soon as I get home I have to make dinner, clean and give my child a bath. If I don’t do these things, my husband will huff and puff until I just can’t take it and I end up doing it anyways. We have been married for 3 months and I’m over it already. He does not have my back financially and I’m not really seeing the point of this marriage. I’m so fed up.  Oh and I don’t even have a ring — we got married at the courthouse and he couldn’t afford a ring. Everytime I bring it up he’s just like “you will get one soon— I’m working on it” I AM OVER IT 

TLDR: I (31F) am completely over my husband (37M). I am the breadwinner and stressed at work and he cannot help me. I am starting to resent him. He does not clean or help with dinner. He wastes our son during the day, that’s it.",offmychest,mixed,2
"Idk where to mentally put myself in this type of relationship I’m not sure how to give the basics of this but I’m 24 going on 25, widowed at 23 and have only really been with that one person. 
Almost this time last year a friend and I made out while intoxicated (nothing else happened passed that) and we decided to keep things going. [still exclusive] Like I said I’d only been with one person for almost 7 years so I didn’t know where to put my mind for things so I asked around September and they said we’ll keep feelings out of it [they’d had a really shitty year and didn’t want it to be a ‘in the moment’ thing and hurt me later] and if they are doing too much to tell them and I was fine with that. They’d been very very patient with me in getting comfortable with going further with things too. 

Come around to December, close to Christmas (we started hanging out more from September to here) and they get me a VERY nice and thoughtful gift (jewelry). In my mind I’m like “friends don’t do stuff like this” and of course I’ve extremely thankful I absolutely love it! 
Move on to New Year’s Eve, they give me a kiss (which I honestly did NOT expect, I can’t remember the last time I got a new years kiss) I was on the phone with my mom and still referred to this person as a friend, they were in the car with me at the time. After the call we talk and I give them a hug. They tell me their feelings were a little hurt that I didn’t want my parents to know who they were, explained that wasn’t intentional at all!! They then confess they really like me a lot but scared to hurt me and break my heart. A day or two after really thinking things over I told them I feel the same for them. [[this person had been extremely caring and sweet to me]]

We spent like almost a full week of not more together in January 
We were each others valentines too, friends had a big party celebrating birthdays and Valentine’s Day. We talked in the car about a situation that just happened with a friend and about trust. REALLY got into our emotions, we are both still scared we will hurt one another. I told them they have treated me so much nicer than my late spouse and I’m terrified that I will push them away or hurt my own heart 
I’m over there quite often and they have now met my mom and has said meeting other family will happen eventually. I’ve already met their mom as they still live with her, they have a great relationship  (perfectly fine in this economy, do it as long as you can) she talks about me moving in at some point and he has brought it up too(idk if jokingly…my place isn’t the best) there was a convo at one point where they said they’d be damned if they were the reason I wasn’t out there anymore and mom would be upset (this was around October) 

While I don’t care for a title I guess I’m not 100% sure what’s going on (sorry for the entire lore drop). But I’m terrified that asking will push them away emotionally.  Most everyone who knows says we basically are a thing, I’ve even thought about asking our close friend who we hang out with. They are extremely kind and have put up with my anxiety and depression dips, I do feel guilt still at times knowing I’m being treated so well now. 

Idk I’m just really fucking scared, don’t know what to do and I’ve gotten so anxious I’ve thrown up 💀I really think I’m just in my head about things which I’m trying to improve on 

*TLDR:* friends with benefits has become more with feelings, there’s no label but things are very much exclusive. We basically act like we’re together in ways. The question of what it is is eating me up, should I ask or leave it be until the year mark comes around? Or let it be period?

"I don’t know what’s wrong with me anymore, and it’s slowly breaking me. 20M - It’s been about two years now. Two whole fucking years of feeling like I’m drifting further away from myself. And lately… it’s just gotten worse. Like I’m slipping deeper into this fog, and I don’t even know when or why it started anymore. I feel this heaviness in my chest that just won’t go away. Sometimes, I can't breathe properly, and I force myself to take deep breaths like that’ll help. I open windows, I turn the fan on full blast, I pace around the room, hoping the suffocation in my own mind will ease up. It rarely does.

I don’t want to talk to anyone. Not my family, not my friends—no one. I’ve become so emotionally withdrawn that even the idea of a simple conversation feels draining. I was talking to my dad today on a video call, and I could barely hold myself together. I was zoning out, and he asked if I had just woken up. I hadn’t. I just… didn’t have the energy to talk. I mumbled a few things and ended the call. And it’s not just with him—it’s everyone. Even replying to messages or texts feels like a burden now. I try to push through, I really do, but afterwards I just get hit with this wave of sadness that makes everything worse. It's messed up, right? Like, I actively avoid talking to anyone, but deep down, I feel this desperate need for someone to just get it, for someone to connect with. It's a total contradiction.

I used to love music, movies, games, chess, photography, even nerding out on physics stuff. I poured my heart into building my dream PC once—it was a whole thing for me. But I didn’t abandon it because I moved or got busy. I lost all interest in it long before that. The passion just… died. And that scares me. Because these were things that used to define me. I don’t even recognize myself anymore.

And oddly enough, when I’m around people physically, I can manage. I can keep myself composed. Those emotional waves don’t crash as hard. But the second I’m alone? It all comes back. Tenfold. That heavy chest feeling, the emptiness, the pressure behind my eyes like I’m about to cry without knowing why. But then, once I get through that wave, it feels like… I don’t know, like nothing happened. Like I was just being dramatic. Honestly, I was all teary when I started writing this post, and now by the end of it, I feel like this is such bullshit.

I’ve never talked about this with anyone before. Not friends, not family, no one. But here I am, typing it to strangers, because what the fuck else can I do? I don’t think I’m suicidal, but the urge to escape is strong. Not to die, just to vanish. To press pause on everything for a while. To not have to pretend I’m okay, or be expected to function, or explain this invisible weight to anyone.

And yeah, the idea of therapy crossed my mind. Mostly because that’s what people usually say helps. But honestly? I’m still pretty cynical about it. I’m not sure how talking to someone—someone I’m paying—is really supposed to help me understand something I can’t even put into words. Sure, I could ask my parents to help out, and they probably would without hesitation, even if I didn’t explain everything. But honestly? That conversation feels too heavy for me right now. I just don’t want to open that door—not yet.
So yeah. I’m stuck. I’m tired. I’m writing this because I don’t know where else to go.",offmychest,mixed,2
"(77m) My 79-year-old sister, whom I loved dearly, died two weeks ago after falling and breaking her hip. In spite of the love I felt for her, there's a very deep reservoir of anger intermixed with my grief. I'm angry because she allowed her only child to destroy her reasons for living. Becky was always a caregiver. When I was little, it was up to her to watch over me while our parents both worked. Back in those days, few parents could afford to pay for childcare.

As I grew into adulthood, she was always the more responsible one. If I had a financial emergency, she was always there to help bail me out with a check. Later on in life, when I had become the more prosperous one, it was my turn to lend her a hand - which I did gladly. Over time, she became more than my sister - she was my best friend.

She had her only child, a daughter, relatively late in life. She was 42 when little Nancy was born. By then, I'd had three children of my own.  Almost from the start, it was clear that little Nancy was going to be spoiled rotten. Showered with 100% of her parent's attention and indulged in every way possible, she grew up to be entitled and irresponsible. In her parent's eyes, she could do no wrong.

She was 18 when she first became addicted to meth. Her addiction led her to cash a stolen, forged check for $500 at her parent's bank. Arrested and charged with a felony by day's end, Nancy's life of addiction related crime was just beginning. She spent the next thirty years in and out of jail and rehab. Moving from meth to heroin and finally Fentanyl. She had a daughter along the way - a daughter virtually raised by my sister because Nancy was too fucked up to deal.

The entire time, my sister could never bring herself to stop giving Nancy whatever Nancy demanded. Three years ago, as Nancy's father lay dying, my sister gave Nancy permission to move in with them. She needed Nancy's help and support. Nancy brought her boyfriend. At this time, both Nancy and the BF were hardcore Fentanyl addicts.

While her dad was in his last days, Nancy and the BF were busily hauling off everything of value they could find and selling it for drug money. They broke into my sister's safe, stole all her cash, maxed out her credit cards to the tune of thirty grand using her stolen ID and emptied her savings account of $30,000. By the time my sister realized what had happened? Her husband was dead, and she was out $60,000.

So, why am I angry? I'm angry because she indulged her entitled daughter her entire life instead of saying no. I'm angry because she refused to turn her daughter in for the crimes she'd committed against her. I'm angry because I could never share my true feelings with her for fear of destroying our relationship.

Becky told me that she was afraid that if her daughter was arrested, that she (Becky) would lose custody of her only granddaughter. The two junkies were allowed to continue living with her and preying on her - eating her food and taking her car without her permission. It took two more years and even worse carnage, and the loss of the granddaughter who was no longer in her custody,  before Nancy was finally forced to move out.

Three years later? My sister wanted more than anything to die and be done with her life. I knew before she fell and broke her hip that her depression had reached the point that dying was the one thing she craved above all else. Two weeks ago, she got her wish. My wish for her, as the brother who loved her during her entire life, is that she refused to allow her daughter's addictions to destroy her own life. If she'd managed that? She might still be alive.",offmychest,mixed,228
"I hate snark subreddits with all my heart The amount of miserable people who take time out of their days to shit on other people’s lives is eye opening. Idgaf about influencers, but the way these psychopaths would talk about how miserable other people’s lives are or go way too deeply analyzing why someone is actually a bad person with nothing to back up their claims, all while being in a cesspool of racism, misogyny, and bullying is one of the most the most self-unaware things on the internet. They’re out here calling people wastes of Oxygen, and while I do think influencers are useless, they contribute more good to society than a snark frequenter ever will.

"I want to go home So today at 2pm we went to my in law’s house to help her clean. She bad a major back surgery and can’t do a lot of stuff at the moment. My husband and my kid were there as well. So u was doing cleaning, i was vacuuming the floor and honestly it was dirty. 

After i was done I mopped the floor, my in law’s have comments about this being dirty or whatever even when i didnt even start the electric mop. I was already irked because it was not her only comment since i started cleaning. It felt like she thinks i dont know what i am doing. So anyway fast forward i was finally down to the last room and it’s her bedroom. 

Floor was dirty and her room has a door leading outside so she was sitting there outside next to her room window with my daughter and my husband pulling weeds. She said that it’s enough because it’s already clean. Now I don’t really like cleaning especially after having such a busy day, worked as kitchen help. (Story for another day) when i clean i make sure it’s clean, not clean-clean but proper clean. 

My head is always all or nothing. I dont know why but this us how im wired. So i stopped mopping. The way i do it is vacuum-mop-let it dry-vacuum because after mopping there tends to be dirt left, just to make sure that it’s thoroughly clean. I appreciate tht after cleaning we are going out to eat, so in my mind okay… but then in law said we are gonna take a half an hour walk and no one is staying in the car. I am tired from work yesterday and I cleaned at her house and now apparently i am obliged to go walk with them, now my husband knows I don’t even like walking, it’s hot outside, humid and sticky. 

So i said i am staying in the car and will just relax, my in law proceeded to say no one stays in the car everyone will go out and walk—- like excuse me i am 29 years old and i can decide if i want to or not. She then said but look at the view it’s wonderful blah blah and i still said the same thing. 
I came from a third world country and a very poor one at that so i think in her head i am very ignorant with a lot of things that are normal to her. 
But i did know things and i had a decent job before i got married. 
Anyway now i feel like i soured the mood for dinner. I don’t feel okay now and just wants to go home but i need to stay because husband and kid is here waiting for food. 
Right now i dont even know what i am typing i feel that like it’s all over the place.",offmychest,mixed,3
"I share every reel I enjoy to myself instead of friends, it’s become a bad habit this is very redundant, but basically, you know how some people have friends that they can share reels to? well over time, my friendships have dwindled, probably because I was the only one considering them my friend. in any case, I made a fake account and when I feel compelled to share something with someone, I just share it again to myself. I think Instagram knows that I’m one of the top people interacting with the content that I come face-to-face with because not only do I like it, but I always share it, so I find myself getting a lot of videos by bigger content creators right when they’re posted because more than likely not only I’m going to like the post, but I’m gonna end up sharing it at least once.

this might seem like a stupid thing to make a whole post about, but I just feel like I can’t be the only one who’s doing this.. Is there anyone else out there who tries to mitigate their loneliness by pretending they’re actually sharing fun and cool stuff with other people?

"It’s very difficult for me to accept that no matter how much work I do nothing is ever promised How can I be okay with the fact that no matter what you do wtv you want is never promised.
I also have a dream of being a global pop star I’m obsessive wjth Beyoncé I get to work I’m learning how to dance, sing, musical production, doing theatre, plays, getting into acting to boost my career, but all this work could literally go in vain my dream isn’t promised and I’ve stopped working for jt because it’s so scary, expensive and time consuming. 

I’ve been struggling with everything but mostly with accepting that no matter how much you grow, work on yourself, be the best version of yourself you could possibly ever be, it doesn’t mean you’ll get a partner or anything you desire at all. And to me this is very painful because one day I want someone to have children with, share all types of yk personal stuff. And no matter what you do it doesn’t mean anything. But the point of this post, is that I’m looking for advice on how to keep going on with everything knowing this possibility, how can I be okay with this like actually happy with this, because I don’t wanna turn into those bitter women who are nasty, jealous, and hurtful to those who can get it. I wanna be okay with it no negativity in my heart at all just pure peace. 

I want love so much because it makes me feel seen, valued, worthy, appreciated and happy I’m full of love even in my darkest moments. I love children even tho I got a lot to work on before I get to that point. But children need mom and dad, like on a psychological level they do, they need both parents healthy and present. I don’t wanna be selfish and have a kid that doesn’t have a dad and long for one and it creates issues. It wouldn’t be right to bury my desire, or be ashamed of it. How can I deal with it and being okay, even if my friends have what I want still celebrate and support them.

"Female Friend doesn't want me but wants to keep me close This girl who I became really good friends and eventually developed feelings for kept giving me mixed signals that she also had feelings for me. She texted me every day, would FaceTime me for hours, sent me drunk texts saying she missed me and loved me, and got upset when I didn’t notice things about her. She even drove an hour one night at 2 a.m. just to sleep over and cuddle. All of that to say she didn’t want a relationship and that she basically didn’t like me. Maybe I’m crazy and totally misread things, and we were just close friends. Who knows at this point.

"Not every cancer patient deserves a miracle. I am a doctor who takes care of cancer patients. A lot of my patients either already have or turn to religion after their cancer diagnosis - they approach death largely (in my experience) in two different ways: the first say “I am going to be with God now- I have fought this cancer hard but  I have lived a good life and this is God’s will.”  These patients die peacefully- surrounded by family and friends on their own terms. 

The others: “God will give me a miracle.” They will be actively dying in a hospital bed, and any intervention would be futile — and I mean ANY.. they are on death’s door- I have spent HOURS preparing them for this moment, we have exhausted EVERY avenue,.. but still they say “God will find a way, God will give me a miracle.” They leave this world kicking and screaming- traumatizing their family and the people around them, leaving behind a long trail of devastation, medical bills and financial confusion because they didn't think about getting their affairs in order in advance (even when being told to). 

Last week I had a patient and his family who had a stage IV cancer.  Halfway through his initial treatment he decided to stop for no reason, and didn’t come back. Six months later he came back with widely metastatic disease, weak, unable to eat, expecting a miracle from God. Well- if God exists- then God gave you that miracle in the form of upfront cancer treatment that could have significantly prolonged your life- even with a stage IV diagnosis.  And you ignored the call. In fact, the whole family did, and now are blaming the medical system for not being able to treat him because he is just too sick. 

Less than 100 years ago there was NO treatment for the disease you have, and now we have many lines of therapy that can prolong your life… but no.. that is not miracle enough. Somehow God giving us the science to understand cancer and help treat it for many people is just not miracle enough. God needs to give you your own miracle to treat only your cancer because for some reason you deserve that attention? No.. absolutely not. What makes you so deserving? Have you live an exemplary life in the service of others? Have you performed miracles for others?  Did you follow the exact teachings of the Bible (if that is your book of choice)? By what moral code did you live so perfectly that you now expect God to focus a miracle on you? Have you helped many hundreds of people? Have you helped even a few? I do not know. It does not matter. A miracle was offered to you… and you blew it. 

There is only one group of people in my mind that truly deserve miracles- innocent children. . The rest of us? We live in too much sin.",offmychest,mixed,1885
"I found out, via an Instagram post, that my maternal grandmother died. No one in my family has reached out to me to let me know. It's been 2 weeks. To be fair, I'm (32m) estranged from most of my family, but I do still talk to my older sister (35f) and younger brother (29m). Albeit in a limited capacity, but we text often enough.

I haven't spoken to my parents in almost 5 years. Our relationship has been... rough for the last 14 years. That's how long my wife (33f) and I have been together. I fought with my parents quite a bit early in me and my wife's relationship because my wife is black and my parents didn't like that too much. They cussed me out, cussed her out, called her every racial slur they could and eventually kicked me out of the house for standing up against them. 

This caused my wife and I to move in together pretty quickly which led to us getting married very young. But honestly, I wouldn't change anything but the trauma we went through. My wife is my best friend and I don't know what I'd do without her and I'm confident she feels the same way. Later this year we will be celebrating our 14th wedding anniversary.

For the first few years after my wife and I moved in together, late 2011 to mid 2013, I didn't speak with my parents. It wasn't until my wife got pregnant in 2013 that we decided to let them know that they were going to be grandparents for the first time. We invited them to the baby shower, but my mom blew us off because she was attending the baby shower for one of her friends instead. We invited them to the hospital when my son was born. I remember them saying they were on the way, they only lived 20-30 minutes from the hospital. My FIL got there faster and he had a 6-hour drive, same with my MIL but in the opposite direction.

We tried to make a relationship with my parents work. We tried to attend family gatherings and dinners and holidays. But every interaction left a bad taste in our mouths and eventually we would just make excuses for why we couldn't go. 

As our son got older, he was diagnosed with level 2 ASD at age 4 or 5. At this point he was completely non-verbal and only just getting the hang of using the toilet with quite a bit of assistance. Our son became the excuse to dip out early or to avoid events entirely. We didn't always lie to get out of stuff, but between the bad vibes involved with going to my parents' house and my son's unpredictable meltdowns, we'd rather just stay home most days. Why mess with our peace and my son's comfort? 

Fast forward to the summer of 2020. Black Lives Matter protests are in full swing. My wife and I are in it. Attending protests, sharing information about how to be safe during protests and also arguing with people on the internet and sharing things related on social media. My mom decided that this would be a great time to say some racist things about the movement and then say that racism doesn't exist in the same breath. 

When we confronted her about it, bringing up the history we've had with her racism, she conveniently has a selective memory, says she doesn't remember saying any of the things she said to me or my wife. My dad defended her, my aunt (her sister) defended her, my younger sister (26f) defended her and even my former best friend who I considered an adopted brother defended her. I blocked all of them on Facebook, which is where most of this arguing took place, and I blocked their numbers. I deleted Facebook shortly after this as well.

I blocked everyone in my family initially and only recently started talking with my older sister and younger brother within the last few years. So far, they have respected my wishes to not be involved with my parents or younger sister.

I grew up most of my childhood at my paternal grandmother's house and was always around my dad's side of the family. Today, I still speak with my paternal grandma and my dad's sister. After my other grandma passed, I've been hesitant to call anyone but I'm compelled to call the one grandma I have left. 

I never really had a real relationship with my maternal grandmother. According to my mom, she didn't always get along with her. That, combined with her living in a different part of the country, didn't cultivate a strong foundation for a relationship. I could have tried harder to build a relationship but I didn't and now it's too late.

Most of my memories as they relate to my grandma are negative because of what my mom has said about her. But as a kid, the few times I did meet her (could probably count on one hand the actual times I've seen her in my life), it was positive! She always sent me music related gifts for Christmas or my birthday. I'm a huge fan of rap music too this day and my grandma bought me my first ever rap album, BowWow's ""Unleashed"". I know, I know, gimme a break, I was 12. She also gave me my first radio to play my CDs on, which I still had when my wife and I moved in together. 

But even these memories are sullied by my mom. The year I got that BowWow CD, we had actually went to grandma's house for Christmas, drove from LA to Missouri. As soon as we got back home, my mom took the CD and cracked it in half. 

I started using Instagram a few years ago to help promote a small business I started in 2023. When I downloaded the app, it had most of my Facebook friends already on there. To my surprise, this included people I had blocked on Facebook. As soon as I realized this, I blocked my parents and my sister. Didn't really care to block anyone else at the time, didn't seem worth the effort. What this meant was that I would still see posts from people like my mom's sister, I just wouldn't interact with them and just kinda lurk. Still, I don't use the app much these days. The business has always been a side hustle and I don't rely on it or push it nearly as much as I used to. 

I opened up Instagram a week or so ago to scroll out of boredom. The first thing I see is a post from my aunt. It was a recent photo of my grandma. She looked the same as I remembered her, but her hair was long and flowing to her shoulders. As a kid, when I had seen her, she always kept it very very short. It looked pretty. I don't open Instagram often, so this post was almost a week old. In the body of the post my aunt explains that her mom has passed after a battle with cancer, which they only found out about less than a month prior. 

I froze. I felt numb and in a way I still do. Maybe it's the lack of a relationship I had with her, or maybe it's the way I found out, or maybe it's anger at my mom for everything. It's probably all of it.

I know that it's unfair to expect my brother or my sister to bear the responsibility of telling me when someone dies, but given the circumstances it is their responsibility. If the shoe was on the other foot, I know in my heart that I would have told them. 

So yes, I blame them for not telling me. I blame my parents for being such shitty people that I can't have a normal relationship with them. If I had, then maybe I would have developed a relationship with my grandma. I'm angry at everyone and I don't know what to do. 

I tried to look up my grandma's obituary or funeral information but haven't come up with anything. She's been married and remarried a few times, and with how everything has been, I don't even know what her last name is anymore. I had 3 possible last names, but they all turned up nothing. I'm not even sure she lives in the same city I knew her to live in 20 years ago. She wasn't on social media at all. I'm heartbroken that this person that I didn't know, never had a chance to know, is gone and I can't even pay my respects without the possibility of facing people that I want nothing to do with. I'm afraid that they will make this about them if I reach out. That they will blame me for isolating myself for the last 5 years. I feel like a fucking teenager all over again and that's pissing me off too.

I think I'm gonna call my other grandma. I know she doesn't have ties with my mom's family, she probably knows about my other grandma but I don't want this feeling of regret tied to her when she eventually goes. 

Before I go, I want to address something before anyone else does. I recognize the irony that I'm angry with my mother for instilling a negative view of her mother onto me in my childhood. My mom is entitled to feel however she has felt about her mom, and I'm entitled to feel how I feel about mine.  Call it generational trauma, idgaf, I know damn well that I'm doing a better job at raising my child than my parents ever could and that's good enough for me.",offmychest,mixed,2
"Sometimes I feel lame cause I was a late bloomer as a teen I’m now 20 and due to COVID, shyness, strict parents, and a drop of autism I was definitely a late bloomer. I had my first kiss at 14 ( or 9 if that actually counts playing house as a kid) and I had my first boyfriend freshman year too. But I wasn’t allowed to date so it was all sneaking around in the hallway and detention after school. During covid which was 15-17 pretty much I didn’t date at all and had like two friends. All the “dating” I did was online. So no dates, no parties, no drinking, no sex nothing

I didn’t go on my first date until senior year and then I met my now boyfriend of 2 years after on SNAPCHAT. I wanted to lose my virginity to another virgin and we didn’t date until 5 months after we met so I was 18. I was upset he lost his vcard a few months before we met (at 17 so jealous of that) and we dated for like a year and a half before I lost my vcard right before I turned 20 once I gave up on my pipe dream. I love him and trust him so I figured I’m ahead of most people when it comes to losing their virginity and finally did at 19. I also started drinking at 19 which is still technically illegal and a teen but it’s still not a traditional teen drinking thing as I was legal in most countries AND my parents let me drink with them or on vacation at 18 so I had tried champagne and a pina colada already. They don’t know I drink with my boyfriend or at the one party I’ve been to this past year but it just feels so late. I wish I had more rebellious, cool teen years to look back on.",offmychest,mixed,3
"I’m pursuing a career in mental health, but sometimes it feels like my own struggles hold me back. I’ve always wanted to help others who are struggling with their mental health because I know what it feels like to feel completely lost in the dark. I’m currently studying psychology with a focus on addiction, working toward becoming a crisis/trauma counselor. But here’s the thing – every day, I still fight my own mental health battles. I struggle with anxiety, cPTSD, and depression.



I often feel like a hypocrite, like who am I to guide someone through their pain when I’m still trying to figure out how to handle my own? But I also realize that my journey through these struggles gives me the empathy and understanding that I could never get from a textbook.



I guess I just need to remind myself that healing doesn’t mean being perfect. Maybe part of my purpose is to show people that it’s okay to not have everything figured out, as long as you’re willing to keep trying and growing.

Now I just feel doomed to a loveless life, ive tried dating apps on and off for the past 2 years and nothing ever went very far, some of the people i thought i would be most compatible with ended up living in other states (im on Long Island so Connecticut and New Jersey get included depending on how big you make your radius) and im an introvert so i dont like going out to bars or anything, i dont know what spaces i can go to to meet people.  At age 28 it kind of just feels like i am fucked.  And i just have this terrible yearning, wishing i could get the feeling of cuddling with someone who i feel vulnerable and trusting with, i want to go on dates, i want to share myself with someone but i cant find that person.

It almost feels pathetic, honestly it might be

Ive talked to some friends about this in the past and i get kind, affirming words. ""Youre good looking youll find someone"" but, i dont feel like i will, and when the night comes, and the loneliness hits, i wish i had something more than kind words to hold onto yk?

"I am too much for people Hey 

So, I am a parentified eldest daughter, fixer, counselor, electrician you name it and i can do it. People from all walks of life come to me, with their help I build them back up and then they leave. Recently had a potential partner encounter with a casual work friend of 6 years and that made me realize, I maybe too logical emotionally, I do listen to people rant for hours but i dont just let them be, I give them advice and help them build themselves back up too. Sometimes, when i care too much i push a little harder because i can see the potential they carry.

  
He broke it off with me and immediately ran to his friend of 10 years to practically propose to her because she would just let him be. She let him grow on his on pace and that comfort made him choose her over me. Maybe that's why I am single, people who are attracted to me for being smart, comforting, intellectual when it comes to bringing those qualities home, i scare them. He kept saying "" He was scared of me"". Maybe i demand too much, i should stop trying to fix people and just let them be, I shouldnt break down everything for them so they can understand the root causes and then help themselves. 

  
So, nobody runs from me, maybe I am not a good listener or maybe i made them feel judged even though everyone says, I have gotten close to you in 3 months more than i am to my bff of 8-10 years. I couldn't have told her all of this etc etc but now all that feels like a lie.",offmychest,mixed,1
"I'm sending my dog over the Rainbow Bridge next week I have to send my baby girl Mary over the rainbow bridge next week.

I adopted her back in 2012. I was 21 and she was 2. I'm now 34 and she is 15. I tried my best to give her a wonderful life. The rescue group I adopted her from said they found her on the street. The moment I saw her picture on their website I knew she was coming home with me. It took her several weeks to warm up to me. For the first few weeks she would stay under the dining room table. I was starting to think I made a mistake because she wasn't coming out of her shell--not even a little bit. One night I was sitting out on the porch and I left the door open in case she wanted to come outside with me and she finally did.

One of my favorite memories was when I took her on a camping trip--it was more like glamping LOL. One of our friends had a camping spot along a river about 4 hours away from us. My friend's brother had a camper so we had a fan for our tent. We went hiking and floated the river on inner tubes. We had a blast.

Another time I had cut our yard and accidentally left the gate open. Normally she waits on the porch to come inside. After about 30 minutes, I noticed she wasn't waiting so I went looking for her. Y'all!!! I walked around the yard and found her waiting at the other door LOLOL.

Last year during her annual vet visit, they advised me that ""comfort care"" would be on the horizon. We started Mary on low dose pain medicine for her arthritis.

During this years annual visit, the vet said that she had lost some weight and wanted to X-Ray her and do bloodwork to see if something else was going on inside to cause the weight loss. Well, it turns out she has a big mass that is more than likely cancerous, her liver is failing, she is anemic, fluid is starting to build up around her heart, she has a 4/6 heart murmur, and her arthritis is pretty advanced. The doctor advised that I could take her to an out of town vet for an ultrasound and surgery on the mass but at 15 it's risky, plus with her other ailments--well I could extend her life but the quality of her life wouldn't be the best.

Of course, I was a mess. I asked the doctor if I would be terrible if I took the rainbow bridge route as opposed to extending her life. She and the techs were so kind and understanding. I've been knowing this was coming but man it still hurts so bad. I'm cooking us some steak this weekend with extra butter and got her a cheeseburger with fries yesterday. I'm so sad y'all, I don't want to do this but I know it is the right thing to do. If you made it this far, thank you for reading <3.",offmychest,mixed,1
"Weird kink So I basically fantasize about being raped, and I genuinely can't help feeling aroused by the thought even though it definitely makes me feel disgusting.

Two days ago a friend confided in me about their abuse and I tried to comfort them about it but I just felt grossed out by myself the whole time.

"Raped by slightly older girl when I was a kid So when I (19M) was 8 I was raped by a girl a little older than me. Here is the longer story. When I was in 2nd grade there was a girl I liked, but I didn't want to fumble it, so I thought ""let me try with another girl first and then try with her after"". So I told the girl who sat behind me, who didn't have many friends (I think she was 9 or 10), that I liked her (which was a lie) and if she wanted to ""go out"" or something. She said yes, I was quite popular in the class, so I did also expect her too. Anyways, a couple of days later we were at my house and in my room. She was like ""let's try something"" and I thought ""okay well she knows about relationships, so sure"". She and I then kissed, but not like a peck, no no no. It was french kissing with tongue. I will also clarify that I had 0 idea on what was actually happening as I was too young to know porn or stuff like that - I am guessing she wasn't. Anyways, after a while doing that, she then had me lay on my couch - again I am just following along and thinking that this is what you do. After I lay on the couch she grabs a blanket and throws it over my bottom half and asks me to take my pants off. Again I follow along. She then goes under the blanket and begins stroking my dick before giving me a bj. I was a bit weirded out by this and it did also feel wrong, but alas I let her continue. Don't remember what happened after this, but fast forward a couple of days and we are in my bedroom again. This time she says ""let's try something else"". She then jumps on my couch and pulls her pants down and tells me to do the same. I again follow along thinking that this is just what you do in a relationship. She then tells me to put my dick inside of her. All I can remember is that I try to do it in her ass, because I ain't even know that women had another hole at this point. Anyways, the next thing I can remember is me asking her if I should go down on her, since she did it to me (not exact wording of course). She says okay and pulls her pants down again (same day I think, but not 100% sure). I remember that there was a dust bunny (I think that is what it is called - english is not my first language) on her vagina and that put me off from doing it. Next I remember us being in her room and all we did there was kiss, this time just regular kisses. The last thing I remember is her showing me what porn was - which is actually where my addiction to that and masterbation started. Also I hadn't actually hit puberty at this point I don't think, so like my dick couldn't even get hard and I didn't actually have any ""extra"" feeling in it yet, from what I remember at least. Anyways, just wanted to write this down and sent it out to the world to tell someone I guess. Will also just say that I think these events have traumatised me a bit and I am actually really scared for when I am going to be with a girl. If anyones as any tips on how to actually deal with this I would greatly appreciate this. No one knows of this story, not my friends, my parents, no one.

Edit: the reason I have told no one is because I am very embarrassed by all of this. I think because I feel that it is my ow fault, you know because I did ask her without really wanting to be with her",offmychest,mixed,24
"I feel like a failure I just turned 21 and I’m currently studying at a college in Australia.This is where I do a degree then transition onto second year at a university of my choice.  I chose to do this after I took a gap year to really look at all the different options and opportunities out there.

Currently, I feel as though i’m not as smart as I thought as I just received my results for quiz I thought I did well on but turns out I failed which really sucks becasue I put a lot of effort into preparing for it. So far this has happened 3 times as of now and If I fail 2 more assignments/ tests/ quizzes I will get kicked out of school due to poor performance.

I feel as though I put so much effort into studying and learning about the content to cope with this but whenever I do a quiz in this specific class I do terrible even though I thought I did well. This honestly makes me feel so dumb and makes me feel like I won’t achieve any of my goals which in turn really makes me feel like a failure.

All my friends that I study with get such good grades which really makes me think about how dumb I am which really sucks because I always study with them to make sure i’m understanding the topic. But the main thing I’m worried about right now is getting kicked out of school. If I end up repeating this pattern then my career goals are over and I will end up being a failure.

"I found messages showing my partner cheated on me Sorry if this is long.

My partner and I have been dating for a year and a half, and the other day I decided to follow my gut instincts and check a chat he had whilst he was working. When I first saw the name of the person a few months ago, something felt off, but I decided to ignore it since I have mental health issues and do jump to conclusions easily. I, however, couldn't forget about it, so to ease my mind, I looked and found sexual texts between him and another woman starting from December last year to just a few weeks ago. Honestly, I was crushed. Before seeing this, I had no reason to believe it was something he was doing. He never hid his phone from me or guarded it at all, he let me use his pc whenever as well. 

When he got home, I tried subtly mentioning that I knew something in hopes he would realise and come clean, but he didn't. He didn't even seem fazed by what we were talking about. He said he had no secrets to hide from me and even joked that if there was anything, then he knew I would find it eventually. Nothing about how he was acting or talking seemed like he'd been caught or did anything wrong. 

I am choosing to stay with him even after finding this because I love him, I just don't know how to confront him about it. I want to find a way to talk to him about it without seeming hostile or too strong about it, as I just want to get the truth out of him. I've spoken to some friends and they say I'm making the wrong choice, which I may be, but it's what I want to do. I just need some unbiased opinions on the matter and some help on how to start the conversation.

"I have no clue what to do?!? Hi so I (18M) and my gf (18F) are really happy together, she’s the most amazing person I have ever met. However, she gets very cut off whenever she’s under extreme stress and she is at the moment. This is just the way she is and I can sometimes get lonely when she goes into this mode, she tries her best to make an effort and stuff but I still sometimes feel a bit alone. I don’t really have any friends outside of her so I end up keeping to myself until she is able to reply. But recently I’ve been just scrolling on instagram and stuff and come across one of her long term friends and I go in their page. Seeing photos of my girlfriend super happy and out with her friends it just makes me super sad because she’s not feeling good at the moment, I also don’t know if it’s me being a bit jealous at the fact that she isn’t like that whenever we are hanging out at the moment?? I just want her to feel okay, she puts in so much work but she never feels it’s enough?! I hate seeing her upset like this. Sorry if this didn’t fully make sense, I kinda just yapped but long story short. My girlfriend is really stressed, sad and distant at the moment, she’s super autistic and it’s how she functions. It’s left me feeling sad and a little alone.

"Tired, so tired Hi all, I hope you are hanging in there. I'm sure several if not the majority of people can relate to this on some level.

I'm so freaking tired. So overwhelmed. All the time. Always playing catch up on things to get done, always behind, always not able to get enough done. Life goes so fast and like everyone I just need a break. There's always something going on, even on the good days. Even when I would consider I'm having a good day, if I think about it, I feel like total shit and like I can't keep up. On bad days I'm drowning in things I can't get done and things I never have time for that I want to do but never feel good enough to do. I'm tired of being sick, tired of being tired, and tired of never having any time where I don't feel this way. 

I'm in graduate school, been trying to get through it, but I have several chronic health conditions that keep getting in the way. My autoimmune diseases seem like they are always flaring at the most inconvenient times, even my nuisance conditions that shouldn't cause problems too severe are making it hard to get done daily tasks like simply standing some days. I'm struggling on how to navigate professional life, and life in general when I'm always so fucking exhausted and everything is always going nonstop. Should probably add that I have ADHD too. So the brain fog is wild sometimes. Like if I could just function at even part of what I should be able to, if if my brain and body would cooperate even 10% more, I feel like it would be life changing. 

I've always been an optimist and a people pleaser and never really realize how awful I feel unless I let myself think about it. I go and go and then suddenly the world is falling apart because I pushed too hard and can't keep up. I've gotten better at that somewhat, but I realized today that part of the problem I think is that I never really tell people how I truly feel. I've spent at least half of my life telling people I'm doing okay when they ask, even when I'm not (unless it's at a doctors office). I've gotten to the point where I now say ""I'm hanging in"" or ""I'm here"" rather than saying I'm okay, but in reality, I need to tell someone that I'm not fucking okay. Not at all. 

Don't worry, mental health wise I'm actually okay. There is no risk I'm going to do anything dangerous, or stupid, or anything concerning. I just need to be honest with someone about how I feel without worrying how they will take it, if I'm unloading too much, or if its going to stress them out. 

People often ask how you are to be polite. It's a social convention, but most of the time, people don't really want to hear how you're doing. Then to make it worse, the ones who do want to hear how you are actually doing are the people who you don't want to upset and worry. The people you love and who care about you are the ones you try to put on a brave face for, and the strangers and acquaintances who don't care likely won't take well to you having a breakdown on them. Then there's the people you open up to, the ones who you thought can handle it, but sometimes it's too much for them and they pull away and that support is gone. You don't want to be too much, you don't want to be the person who complains about their life or how they feel, you don't want to overwhelm others or make them worry... so you say you're okay. You say you're hanging in there. When really you want to break down in tears and let yourself have the existential crisis that has been pushing on the back of your mind for months or years. 

I have a psychiatrist and psychologist. I adore them both. The psychiatrist can't do anything to help because I'm too scared to change my medication to see if it helps my brain work better as I don't want to loose how well my current meds work. My psychologist is the absolute sweetest and I've been with her for so long that now I worry about causing her stress (I know burnout in psych is a big thing, and I'm sure it must be difficult not to take work home with you). Plus, each of our appointments is just me updating her on the latest craziness and chaos, we never even get to do much therapy, it's 75-90% here's what has happened since our last visit. This realization I had is definitely something I'm going to bring up with her next visit though.

Thankfully I have my significant other who is there for me when I have meltdowns, and my parents and brother sometimes too. I just don't want to worry them. Especially when I know they already worry so much...

I also feel like things could be so much worse, so it's really not that bad. I'll be struggling but think ""oh, this isn't as bad as that one time you..."". It can be hard to properly explain to people how awful you feel when you still feel so much better than you've felt previously. When you feel like you've been hit by a truck and have the flu, and every time you move you're muscles it burns like you've worked out for days, but at least you're not having to go to the ER, so you're doing better you guess. Like if people ask how you are in that context, what are you supposed to say? I'm doing better but I still feel like death warmed over? That's not a socially acceptable answer, and people won't know how to respond to that, and it will be awkward. So you say you're hanging in, better than you were, or you're managing. But that's not the full truth, and most people don't want to hear it or don't handle hearing it well.  

I feel like if I told people about how I'm truly feeling though it would help with self awareness. I have difficulty knowing when I'm pushing it too hard, and when to ask for help. I'm starting to think it's because I've spent so long putting on a mask for other people that I forget to take it off and check in with myself. I don't know how to know when it's okay to be honest with people though, or who can handle it. I need to start journaling or something, but my ADHD brain never gets me past the first like two or three days. Plus I'm too exhausted and that would be one more thing on my list that adds the the weight. Maybe I just need to periodically come on Reddit and let the world know I'm a mess to get it off my chest 😅. 

Anyway, who else is fucking exhausted and overwhelmed and feels like it never ends?",offmychest,mixed,2
"I have to break my first loves heart tonight. I will keep this as brief as possible, I am in the middle of work and dying from anxiety here. 

Apologies for formatting and spelling, I’m on mobile!

 I (20f) dated my Ex (24m) for 2 years officially, but talked exclusively for about 2 years before that. (Yes I know illegal and wrong.) We lived together, had pets together and did everything together. We ended up breaking up last year and I moved away in October. Since then he has disrespected my wishes for no contact and continues to try and reach me. I still have love for him and want him to be happy. But I feel like I have realized I don’t want to go back. Even though we were happy overall, there were so many little betrayals that drove me crazy over the years. he is a good man, we have similar life goals and honestly were best friends. 

After a few weeks of going back and forth and no contact failing. I told him we would have a final phone call tonight. I just need to know that leaving him behind is okay. even though over all we could have worked.

"Update: Reddit was by Right (Deleted Post) Reddit was right 😐😐😐: An update from a deleted post from a different channel

Last March/April I wrote a post about one of “friend’s” boyfriend saying the n-word in front of me. 

I deleted the post because of a few reasons (a lot of commenters were disparaging and undermining my blackness) BUT that thread was right about one thing: I should have dropped the friend.

After the situation, I simply stopped talking to her and it lasted for three weeks. She managed to catch me heading to my dorm room (next door neighbors) and gave a half-ass apology and of course, was crying during the whole ordeal. She even said she’d get her bf to apologize, he never did.

I thought I was being the bigger person but “accepting” the apology and simply just be an arms-distance from her in terms of friendship.

Fast forward to today, ANOTHER incident in my friend group led to her trying to state I was wrong in this situation.

TL:DR I told a roommate of racist friend to leave a birthday party for my roommate (in a respectful way of course). This uninvited person has talked behind birthday girl’s back for months and thought she roofied people, hence why I uninvited her.

Y’all were right, she was weird and I should have stopped being friends with her.

If it makes anyone feel better, a very…public shading and videos about anti-racism implying her have been made. And many people that I know and even old friends from my HBCU are supporting me.

I’m sad because people that I thought were my friends, weren’t. They were okay with hanging out with someone they didn’t like because they thought they were “keeping the peace.” 

Long story short: If a friend shows you a red flag, RUN!

I can write a whole other post about the situation if needed.",offmychest,mixed,2
"My best friend (F27) is experiencing her first relationship while I (F27) am healing from heartbreak and still waiting As you can see, we’re both late bloomers and never had any experiences with guys. While I have many platonic guy friends and generally meet new people more frequently than her, it has never worked out for me. I have pretty high standards and terribly bad luck so far. So the few times I have dated, it ended up with them choosing someone else over me or it was the right person but wrong time.

At the same time, my best friend is getting into her first relationship and currently experiencing all her firsts.

"I [21F] am in an unhealthy friendship with my [20F] friend TW: severe mental health problems, depression, brief mentions of suicidal ideation and attempts. 

This story is quite vague because people I know have Reddit. I also ask that if any YouTube channel sees this, please do not read it to your audience. 

So I met this girl named Shayla when we were both in high school. We bonded over a shared interest in a pretty niche anime.

Before I start this post, I need to make you understand why I am friends with Shayla. She is funny, she listens to my petty drama and stupid issues, and when we met, we had shared hobbies. She is a sweet girl. 

There is some other, harder to talk about context needed as well. It became pretty apparently early on in our friendship that due to terrible, abusive parents and other factors outside of her control, that Shayla is deeply depressed and suicidal. 

Now, for what I meant by unhealthy:

Within a few months of being friends, she started texting me at odd times of the day some really horrible things regarding her mental state. I, at the time, would spend basically one night a week talking her down from the edge. I know now that this is unhealthy for my mental health and should not be my responsibility. Even then I knew that, but I was afraid of what would happen if I didn’t do it. I used to be afraid that if I didn’t answer my phone in the night that I would wake up the next morning and find out that she is dead. 

I won’t go into much detail on this one, but the messages stopped about a year into our friendship. There was an incident that involved Shayla and the police that ended in my friend in the hospital and me sobbing hysterically in the hallway of my apartment building. After the incident, the depressive spirals to me over message stopped. She said that she felt remorseful for how she handled things and promised me that she would stop putting so much on me. I believed her and we moved on. 

Again, I won’t go into much detail, to protect our privacy, but things have gotten better and so much worse for Shayla since then. Her behavior has changed to reflect that. Over the last few years, either due to the depression or her family, she hasn’t done much to help her mental health. She is not employed, she is not in college, she has a therapist, but she doesn’t trust her. Beyond that, she shows little effort towards doing something about this. 

Shayla has started texting me in the middle of the night again, but this time it’s different. I’m becoming apathetic in a way that scares me. 
I found an article about empathy sickness not too long ago and I almost cried because it sounded so much like what I have become. I don’t want to be numb, but at this point I’m a little scared of what will happen to me if I’m not. 

Also, maybe because of that apathy, I’m starting to realize other things about our friendship. I’ve also started to notice some behaviors when we are together that are very manipulative. 

1. She often uses threats of bad behavior to get her way. Usually it’s small, childish behavior, but sometimes it’s something bigger and related to her mental health. Think threatening not going to her therapy appointment if I don’t text her later. 
2. She uses guilt trips. Sometimes she will bring up her suicide attempts as a way to get me to tell her things or do something she wants.
3. She love bombs me. She has told me repeatedly that I am the reason she is still alive. Her family has also pulled this one on me. 
4. She uses her previously ended friendships and trust issues against me. This goes with the love bombing in a way. She talks about how I am the only one she trusts won’t leave her. 
5. She expects me to take care of her in some ways. When we go out, there is an expectation that I am the one paying for things. She treats me like a surrogate mom in other ways. She once fully said “you know you’re basically my mom,” before I shut her down on that. 
6. Her abusive family members are starting to expect me to save her. They see me as a good influence. Her mom has called me to try to convince her of things before. Her dad tries to get me to side with him on an arguments. 
7. She hasn’t learned. She says she’ll stop but she’s begun to tell me things that she really should tell her therapist and not me again. I can’t help her. There is nothing I can do and it all leaves me feeling helpless because I want her to feel better but there is nothing I can do. 
8. I don’t see a good end to this. She isn’t seeking proper help anymore. I don’t know what I can do. 

So I’ve realize that this isn’t healthy. I know that this is not good for my mental health, but now I don’t know what to do. The thing is, she has shown potential to change and it leaves me conflicted. I once brought up one of these issues to her and she has made progress towards stopping the behavior after some argument over it. But the thing is that she sometimes tries to weasel through loopholes to get around it and I am scared that this will be like the messages and that if I don’t strictly enforce it, the behavior will come back. 
On top of that, I fully and truly believe (not because Shayla has told me this) that if I leave her she will try to kill herself again. I don’t know if she will stop if I point out her behavior. She’s not doing this on purpose, but also even if we get into a small argument she sulks and ends our friendship over text and then comes back not long after. I don’t want to suffer in silence anymore but I don’t know what to do. I just wish that I could make her happy.",offmychest,mixed,1
"My best friend hates because of Tinder Am I in the wrong?

I've known my best friend for around 10 years, we met when we were a part of a dance studio. We've traveled together and we talk to each other everyday. I love her and she is my only girl friend. 

Over a year ago she got out of a 4 year relationship, I supported her from the get-go. The middle of last year she started using dating apps and started talking to men. She would confide in me and I would give her advice, literally always on her side. My best friend started dating this guy about 3 months ago after talking for around 2 months. She told me he would be moving away in October but she was okay with the idea of long-distance as she's working in healthcare and will be in nursing school. I've never met the boyfriend, I've only ever spoken a few sentences to him while she was on the phone with me. The boyfriend just took her on an out-of-state road trip vacation with his group of friends, I was happy for her. 

A part of the boyfriend's friend group is a high school bully of mine. I told my best friend about it and she kind of remembered some of my experiences, I told her not to mention me at all during her trip. My anxiety and paranoia was getting the best of me while she was on her trip, I pictured her having the time of her life with someone that made me feel miserable and invalidated my experiences. 

When my best friend got back, she made jokes about being friends with my bully and while she was showing me pictures of the trip there were so many of just my best friend and my high school bully. From then, I was somewhat upset with her, I tried not to show it. I know I can't be angry with her because she can be friends with whoever the hell she wants BUT it still hurts. 

About 4 days after her trip she tried to call me at work, I started texting her and she told me that they broke up. I said he was a douchebag for doing that. She responded by saying that it wasn't like that, I told her I'm at work and I don't really know what else to say, he was a douchebag for that. Later that night I texted her saying I was there for her. She never responded. 2 days go by and I texted her saying I wanted to talk about whatever is going on, she proceeded to send me 2 long texts saying that she doesn't want to talk and I'm insensitive, I'm not there for her, and I'm not being genuine. This really hurt, I texted her saying I don't want to text about it, I'd rather call. A week later she actually decided to answer my call and we talked on the phone, she was being extremely defensive for the first half of the call. I apologized to her and told her I know I didn't say the right thing. We started bickering a little bit until my boyfriend interjected and mediated it. The call ended by her saying that she will reach out and tell me what happened when she's ready, she told me that she is not ignoring me to hurt me.

At this point, she is. It's been a month. I have periodically texted her and have been trying checking in with her, she has been radio silent. She has been posting on Instagram with other friends and is actively on her phone. 

She has never done this to me before, we've never really been in a fight. I'm 22 and I'm getting to the point where I don't want to play a cat-and-mouse childish game of ignoring each other. I'm really hurt by her and everyday I'm waiting for her to reply. I'm going through a weird stage of grief where I want to slap her but I also miss spending time with her. I'm not sure if I'm willing to be her friend anymore after this and I can't stop thinking about, it's basically killing me at this point.

Once again, am I in the wrong?",offmychest,mixed,2
"My adult son keeps making threats, and I’m at a loss I'm not sure what I'm looking for, maybe support, maybe advice.

My adult son has a serious issue. He keeps making threats in writing. They're not things he ever intends to follow through on, but that doesn't make them any less serious. He's already been involved with the police and courts. He has had no-contact orders (and has violated them), has been on probation, and has spent time in lockup. He's managed to avoid actual jail time so far, though I don't know if that streak will last much longer.

Just today, I got a call that he’s been picked up again for making a threat, apparently against someone he doesn’t even know. It may have been online, but I don’t have any details. Yes, I pay for his legal representation because I want him to have a fair chance in the system. But none of the seriousness is getting through to him.

The thing is, outside of this one huge and destructive issue, he’s actually a decent person. He lives at home, has always held a steady job, doesn’t do drugs, and doesn’t drink much. He’s had therapy and takes medication, although not always consistently. He’s been diagnosed with ADHD and depression. He was in special education growing up, but the only formal diagnoses were developmental delay and ADHD.

In many ways, he’s still like a child: immature, impulsive, and unable to fully grasp consequences (obviously!) But because he's an adult, I often don’t know what’s going on day to day until everything blows up. I try to stay out of his business unless he asks for help, but then the damage is already done.

I feel helpless watching him self-destruct and worried sick that one day the legal system is going to finally lose patience. And even then, I don't think jail or more probation is going to fix what ever is broken in him.

If you’ve been through anything like this, I’d really appreciate hearing about your experience. Even if you haven’t, thanks for reading. It means something just to put this in wiring",offmychest,mixed,1
"I'm scared of my mom (Before I get into anything this is my first post on Reddit and I don't post on any socials)

So this all started a few weeks ago where I was at my grams house and we for some reason were talking about trans people. At that time I knew that I was trans (I'm 15 and  mtf) and my mom was talking about how she hated that people were altering their bodies. (This isn't exactly what she said but it's close to what she said) Since she said that I've been scared of coming out to her and I'm scared to even be in my own home. Recently either yesterday or the day before me and my mom were talking about something unrelated and we eventually started talking about discord and she then asked why I had She/Her pronouns in my bio and I just started to freak out. I told her that it was just for online anonymity but she replied with ""but you're not!"" And then I just repeated myself and run upstairs to my room. I'm scared of my mom and I don't know how to come out to her without anything bad happening to me.",offmychest,mixed,2
"My sister in law gave my daughter a camera that had a nude pic saved on it X Post from another sub, just looking to see other people's thoughts. 


I do want to give a bit of background here first, because I think some of what I'm feeling is due to the fact that my sister-in-law (SiL) has already crossed a few boundaries with us in the past couple weeks. Heads up, this is gonna be long.


Let me start by saying that my wife and I are fairly religious. I like to think that I'm not too big of a prude, and many of my friends have said that I'm not super judgmental of their life choices as long as they respect mine. My SiL (wife's younger sister) was raised in the same tradition, though she is atheist today (she says that she's experimenting with Wicca and uses tarot cards, crystals, and manifestation). I'm totally fine with this, to each your own, I just asked that when she's in our house she be respectful of our practices and be considerate how she discusses her beliefs vs ours in front of the kids etc.


One thing I will also add, over the last year or so, SiL and her husband (BiL) have decided to have an open relationship and are currently in a poly relationship with another married couple. Again, I'm not here to yuck her yum, they're all adults and can make their own choices. However, two weekends ago she came to visit with her husband the the female counterpart of their companion couple (I'll call her Stacy because it's not her name). We said that we will treat everyone respectfully, but we did ask that they avoid engaging in PDA with Stacy in front of our kids. My kids are aged 7, 5, and 2, and we would rather have those conversations with them when we feel ready to have those conversations with them and feel like they are ready to understand. Not that I want to completely shelter my kids, and I would ultimately prefer them to make their own informed choices regarding God and life, etc, but I do think that 7 and 5 is still a little young for certain conversations.


Anyway, on Easter, when they were in town, my wife asked that they do not come over. We live in a state where recreational cannabis is legal, while they do not, so they had told us that on Easter (being 4/20) they were gonna be blazing the whole day. I don't really mind being around drink and high people generally, but my wife has had some really negative interactions with her sister while sister was high, and she doesn't like to see her in that condition. SiL agreed and said that she'll just come see us on Monday instead. Well, she ends up showing up unannounced to surprise us, but she was basically sober so w/e. Couple hours later tho, and BiL and Stacy show up (also completely unannounced) and walk right in, with his arm around Stacy's waist and they're both completely wasted. They didn't stick around long, but my wife still felt pretty betrayed. Two days later, we had all three over for dinner. They were much more respectful regarding PDA, BUT they kept calling each other babe and honey etc. throughout the meal. In both of these situations, it's like a boundary was clearly set, and while it wasn't technically crossed, it was definitely pushed.


So that's the background (I can definitely add more details/history if requested, but that should give you a rough idea).


On Christmas, SiL gave my 5 y.o. daughter a kid camera. It's a cute device that prints a little B/W copy of the pic and saves a digital copy you can download later, plus it's got a couple games. It's on Amazon for like 30 bucks. So today, my wife is driving the kids to the post office after work, and she hears in the back seat, ""[Older sister], I don't really like this boobs picture."" My wife takes the camera, and, lo and behold, there's a selfie of SiL and Stacy, naked, boobs touching, full boob including nips clearly visible. I poke around the device's memory, and it seems that they took that and a few other photos prior to wrapping it up for Christmas. It just feels like she doesn't care. I mean, I know it was an accident, but why wouldn't you double check to delete it before giving it to a child? It all just feels so inward focused and self countered without thinking of how her actions affect others. 


Anyway, my wife was ticked. We had a long conversation with my daughter about not letting people take pictures of you naked and not letting people show you pictures of themselves naked etc. My wife wanted to call SiL right then, and I encouraged her to calm down first. Eventually, my wife sent her a text saying, hey, this happened, please be careful what you give to my kids in the future. SiL responded: ""Oh my gosh I am so sorry, I didn't realize it had digital storage!!! That is so unacceptable I'm sorry this was a really bad accident, I will make sure it doesn't happen again"" This is frankly hard to believe, as she SHOWED us the features of the camera (including the digital storage) when my daughter opened it. Either way, we're both still upset.


I don't really know what I'm looking for posting this. It's like somewhere between a rant, an ""am I the jerk,"" and a little bit just seeking validation and vindication on my feelings and response here. I guess the biggest thing is probably just wanting an anonymous platform to air my frustration, so if nothing else, ty for listening to my rant.


Either way, I'm curious to hear other people's thoughts and responses to this situation. Sorry it got so wordy.",offmychest,mixed,0

"I am girl (19) and my boyfriend (24) doesn't appreciate or care about my jokes We have been together for about 2 months now and I have had it. I am done telling banger-level jokes to this man only for him to blink at me like I just farted in Latin. I’m 19. He’s 24. Which means he’s had FIVE extra years on this Earth to develop a sense of humor and yet somehow he managed to dodge all the jokes, memes, joy, and serotonin life had to offer. Evolution really dropped the ball with him.

I could say, “Hey babe, what do you call cheese that isn’t yours?” and this man would stare at me like I just declared war on dairy. Not a chuckle. Not even a pity smirk. One time I made a perfectly timed sarcastic remark and he LITERALLY went, “Huh?” and checked his phone. Bro. I just delivered Oscar-worthy wit and you’re scrolling *LinkedIn*??

He’ll watch a guy get hit in the nuts with a shovel on YouTube and laugh like he just heard George Carlin reincarnated, but if *I* make a clever pun, he looks at me like I committed a crime against comedy. I’m not asking for a standing ovation — just *react*, dude. Pretend you have a pulse.

The worst part? I’m hilarious. My friends, my mother, my gay brother and his even-more-gay boyfriend seem to think I am funny. But him? I could dress up as a clown, juggle flaming chainsaws, and recite a Shakespearean roast of Elon Musk, and he’d just blink twice and say, “You done?”

So yeah. Maybe I should start charging this man for my daily performances. Or just date someone who thinks humor is sexy and not some evolutionary defect to be squashed out of existence.

Anyway. Thanks for listening. Hope *you* laughed, unlike my boyfriend, whose soul was apparently forged in a humorless void.

**TL;DR:** My boyfriend never laughs at my jokes or even acknowledges them, and it's making me feel like I'm slowly dying inside while doing stand-up comedy to a ghost. I don’t know if this is just a personality mismatch or if he’s emotionally unavailable with a side of zero humor. Either way, it's draining.",offmychest,mixed,0
"Lost friend of 20 years So I have just lost a friend of 20 years. To explain we were at a after party of a baby shower and there had been some drinking when my friend's spouse's uncle who lives with them started to try to touch my girlfriend inappropriately my gf kept telling him no and she had to go hid in the conner for a minute so i could stop him. I told him to stop but he kept trying finally after a tense standoff and my friend's wife intervening, He left the party. The next day I told my girlfriend that I need to talk to my friend about what happened, my gf was talking to one of her friends that had already knew about what happened and her friend texted our friend circle saying she was starting drama. After this my Friend texted her and told her we are not welcome at their home along with some other nasty things and defended the uncle. It really hurts because I have known this friend my whole life and can't believe he would do this and stand up for this creep. Even if he apologized, I don't think I can forgive him nor trust him again.

"Im not sure what to think. I am 20 f and my boyfriend is 19 m. We have been dating for about 5 months now and we are pretty serious. There are only a few issues that seem to be making me have doubts recently. At the beginning of our relationship he messaged his ex it wasn’t anything flirty or anything like that. However he had told me previously how much he hated her because of what she had done to him. So it threw me off when i found out that he had done that. I have a difficult time trusting people due to my past (which i won’t get into) so him doing that really made me a lot more aware of how he was acting and what he was doing. He hasn’t done anything wrong in our relationship other than that and lying to me a couple of times. One day i went on his phone and seen 15 odd messages between him and his friend calling me controlling and manipulative? when i asked him about it he just said he was spiralling and it was because he’s been hurt before and that none of it was true. I don’t really know what to think? as that really hurt me but also i might be hurting him without even being aware of it. I don’t want to be that type of person i really really do love him. 
Its also hard right now to bring anything up to him as he recently tried to kill himself after an argument that we had. I had to drive to the bridge and get him to get down which was really traumatic but again i don’t feel like i can bring this up to him as im scared he will feel bad about it. And do it again.

"Feeling stuck between loneliness and disillusionment with modern relationships I’ve been sitting with a lot of feelings lately about being single, and I’m realizing it’s more complicated than just wanting a relationship. I’m chronically single, and despite a lot of effort, nothing has really stuck. I do want a relationship—but not just any one. I’m holding out for a healthy, aligned connection. And that’s where things get frustrating.

In the past, I used to feel left behind or even resentful when friends got into relationships or got married while I stayed stalled in singleness. But lately, I’ve noticed a shift. I’m no longer envious—if anything, I find myself disturbed by the kinds of relationships many people around me are in.

Some of my friends are dating or married to men I frankly dislike. In some cases, I’d even call the relationships emotionally or mentally abusive. There’s also this other side of things where I’ve had to let go of friendships because of how relationship-centered they’ve become. And I don’t mean “they value their partner”—I mean things like:

- Inviting me out under the impression it’s a one-on-one hang and then their partner shows up.

-Canceling plans because they got a last-minute date.

-Vanishing into their relationship and only resurfacing when their partner isn’t available.

-going on and on about how they’re really only interested in making/engaging with “couple friends” now.


I had a friend who stayed in a situationship with a man who explicitly said he didn’t want to be in a monogamous relationship with her. She still acted like they were together. When he finally broke things off, she spiraled to the point that I was afraid for her safety—and I stayed with her, nurtured her, tried to help. Weeks later she suddenly had a new boyfriend. I didn’t find out until they were engaged (7 months later), and she told me she hadn’t said anything because she thought I was “jealous” of her past relationships—when all I did was express concern over how she was being treated. 

And that’s the thing—so many of the relationships I’ve witnessed come with really heavy dynamics. Things left unspoken, emotional manipulation, unhealthy dependency. It’s not just that I don’t envy them—I actively feel relieved not to be caught in some of those patterns.

So here I am: craving deep romantic connection, but also not seeing any relationship around me that I’d want to trade places with. I don’t envy them. I don’t want to settle for emotional immaturity, abuse, or being someone’s rehab center.

And lately I’ve been wondering—do I even want romance, or do I just want the kind of emotional intimacy and care that our society only seems to make room for inside romantic relationships? If friendship were truly valued and emotionally rich, would I still feel this ache?",offmychest,mixed,2
"My pregnant friend is getting cheated on and I can't tell her More than I can't tell her it's I have weighted out the options back when I first found out and I realised I was in no position to tell her.

A little bit of context:
I was friends with this girl in my childhood, we were neighbours and would spend many days playing together. She's a sweet girl who tries to appear confident and badass but deep down she has a golden heart.

I moved countries over 10 years ago so I haven't been in contact with her for ages and we obviously lost our friendship.

Some months ago a younger friend of mine told me that my friend's boyfriend was at one of her friend's party and he was making out with 15 year olds. 
He also slept with a 15 year old all night and even had breakfast in the morning a few days before my friend posted a cute New Year's couple's picture.
He also has two phones.

I weighted my options and thought about telling her but I first asked my family and my other friends for their opinion on this. I didn't want to make a rushed decision without thinking about it logically. I was going to write her anonymously. So what stopped me? 

1. He's highly dangerous, he's associated with this gang that has money and power in that village. On top of these connections he is also aggressive and violent with others. He's someone that wouldn't care about the consequences if you wrong him.
I couldn't risk him finding out that my friend told me and I told his gf. I would be first of all putting my friend in danger since she lives in the same village as them.

2. How do I know he would find out? All his boys know about it but nobody would snitch on him as they haven't done in all these years.
She has beef with one of his friends and would have a reasonable motive to tell on him.

3. She might not believe me. He is a very good liar and manipulator so I'm 100% certain he'd twist this and make it seem as if someone out there is jealous and lying and that he only maybe kissed the girl because he was drunk etc.
 I would basically make them have a temporary crisis then all will be back to normal.

4. Number 3 is reinforced by the fact that they were about to get marrier in two months and she might have let him slide because they had already spent money and resources into that wedding.

5. I met her in the shop and made a sad and weird face when she told me she was about to get married. I don't think she got the hint since she might have just thought I was jealous. My face had clear concern on it but it wasn't even my intention to go further than that since she was accompanied by someone else.

Now she's pregnant and I'm 100% sure he'll keep cheating on her and she'll end up miserable and divorced. 

The whole village must know about this affair but everyone is too scared to snitch on him.

It's a pretty shitty situation and yes I do feel crap for not telling her. I wish it wasn't this complicated and I could just tell her.

It's too late now, she'll eventually find out and I can only wish her the best and to find a respectful guy that truly loves and deserves her.",offmychest,mixed,1
"My husband remembers The Brownie Rule™️, even when I don’t My husband and I made up The Brownie Rule™️ early on in our marriage (over 10 years ago). It’s been over 5 years since it’s been used. The rule is, when there is an odd number of brownies, I get the extra. 

We got an order of Domino’s brownies with our dinner this week, and he did the divvying up of the brownies. He gave me my half and said, “There, we’ve followed the brownie rule!”

I had totally forgotten, so he reminded me. He is always honest with me, and thinks the world of me. He makes me smile every day, is a great communicator, a fantastic parent, and so driven to take care of our family. 

He has been by my side as my best friend since 2010, we’ve been together since 2011, and got married in 2013. I was 19, and we were so sure of each other, and everyone saw that he treated me so well, that there weren’t any actual objections to us getting married so young. When I wound up with schizoaffective disorder, I was just a shell of a person and was not the most pleasant person to be around. He was there by my side, encouraging me to keep going, taking care of our son and home, keeping up with my medical stuff, and doing whatever he could to keep us afloat when I was unable to work for a few years.

My daughter said the other was a shiba inu so I looked closer and noticed it was a large yorkie without a doxxed tail.

I thought of my old dog but it didn't click at first! Once I realized there probably aren't a lot of giant yorkies running around I took a closer look.

It was him! I gave him some snuggles and added his owner on instagram and took a picture (he was giving me a kiss). He is well groomed and well trained. I am so happy I got to see him again and he is happy/healthy.

"After 22 years, I finally learned how to ride a bike! This may seem like a small achievement to some, but to me, it means the world. 

I grew up pretty poor and never learned how to ride a bike, but I’ve always wanted to. My dad was very good at it when he was younger, but unfortunately he had his bikes stolen before I was born. I always admired him for his skill, and wished I could be like him someday. 

Well, I’m 22 now and one of my relatives who no longer rides decided I could have their bike. It needed cleaned and a new chain,  and I did that. I’m overweight and my balance isn’t great, so for the first two times I tried learning with the help of my roommate I got very frustrated and just could not get it.

But today, I tried yet again, and of course i couldn’t get it no matter how hard I tried and I was getting so incredibly frustrated, I thought it must’ve been because I wasn’t talented and just could not get it.

But suddenly, right when I was about to quiet, a few young men in a nice grey sports car rolled up to the parking lot and rolled down the windows and shouted “YOU’RE DOING GREAT! YOU’VE GOT THIS!” And then drove off. And honestly, this helped so much, I think it was the last push I need - I immediately put my all into my next attempts and I DID IT! I fucking DID IT, guys! I’ve been wanting to do it for so long and I finally managed to ride it! A few more tries with my roommate pushing me, then I managed to do it myself several times!

The neighbors of my apartment complex who were outside at that point even cheered me on and gave me tips, and it was so awesome to be able to do something I’ve always wanted to do.

I know this really is a small achievement, but I already feel myself wanting to get back on and do it again tomorrow. I have a feeling this will help me get out of my depressive episode and finally help me get some exercise. It’s a huge achievement for me and I’m so proud of myself for it.

To whoever those young men were in the grey car, thank you so much - you gave me the final push I really needed to finally be able to move forward.

Every time I ride now I think of my dad - thank you for everything and I just wish you were here to see me now.",happy,joy,27

I got to the register and a lady behind me was looking kinda nervous with a sole bag of rice. I thought she was maybe going to ask me to go ahead of me, I had probably 10 or 15 things, not much, but still, I was going to let her go first, I was in no hurry.

My kid, being the goofy kind soul he is, started to march around her bag of rice that she left so that on one would take it either. She came back not a minute later, grateful and talking to my kid for a bit. 

Once my things had been checked, I realized I had left my wallet in the backpack! I kinda panicked. I could use a QR code to pay, but I had not enough money in that account and my second account didnt' work with the QR code. I called my husband to ask him to pay, that I would send him the QR code, but the lady at the register was already giving me the stinkiest eye ever. 

After 3 minutes of waiting (I checked) and husband not being able to pay and also getting worried on the other end of the line, I told the exasperated woman behind the register to just cancel the whole transaction and I would be back within 10 minutes. It is then that the lady behind me said ""Hey, I can pay it for you and then you can transfer the money. That okay?"" I was like ""Yes! Thank you so much! Give me your number, I'll do it right now. Thank you again!"" She was all smiles and told me it was no problem. She paid my bill, paid hers and then I transferred the money to her account. 

It was such a nice moment for me. It left me smiling for the rest of the night.",happy,joy,39

"How my now Fiancé healed me of my baggage with a kiss. I just wanted to come on here and document one of my most healing moments l've ever experienced-even if it happened over a year ago now, I still remember it like it was yesterday!

For context, I used to have trauma relating to physical touch from my first relationship (among other things, but that's not relevant for this story), where one of the results was in a fear of kissing.

With that being said, here's my story:

After taking years to heal from my prior abusive relationship, I (22F) finally felt ready to enter back into the dating scene. After searching (for surprisingly not a long time), I matched with my Fiance (27M), and we started going out.

I was very much a slow burn, and I warned him as much. Once we were a few dates in, he asked if he could kiss me for the first time. Of course, with me being a slow burn and having a reluctance towards kissing, I politely turned him down. But I also made sure to reassure him that I was definitely interested in him, just that I needed more time.

Now, after a few more dates, I was really starting to fall for this guy. After a particularly lovely night where he took me to a concert and the night was filled with laughter and conversation, he asked once more if he could kiss me, right as I was leaving his car.

I looked at him, and just felt so in awe of him. I thought, ""Man, I'm really starting to like this guy. I think he's earned it- he deserves at least one wholesome peck."" More importantly, I wanted to give him a kiss.

In the abusive relationship that I was in, I always felt forced, manipulated, or bargained into giving physical affection- particularly with kisses. The first kiss I ever shared with my ex gave me the worst gut feeling I have ever felt in my life. I truly believe that feeling was from my guardian angel, and that I was being warned about the relationship I was entering.

Anyways, back to this newfound healthy love!

We leaned in and shared the most wonderful kiss. I cannot stress this enough- it felt unreal. It couldn't have lasted for more than half a second, and yet time genuinely seemed to stop for me. I experienced the most intense feel-good butterflies l've ever felt. It seemed just like the movies and stories l've read; sparks seemed to fly around us in that moment.

It was such a beautiful, healing moment for me. To go from such horrible, gut-wrenching fear and trauma, to feeling over the moon in happiness is something I'll never forget.",happy,joy,62
"I finally have pants after only being able to wear pajama bottoms for almost a year I gained a lot of weight after graduating high school and stopped fitting into most of my pants. After almost a year of having almost no actual pants left to wear and just dealing with awkward-fitting pajamas, I went thrifting, picked up 5 pairs of pants, and they all fit amazingly. I have pants! I like dressing nicely, so I’ve felt so insecure not having any clothes to wear apart from one ill-fitting pair of slacks and two pairs of sweatpants that are way too hot for my climate that I just gave up on the way I dressed and have largely stopped going outside or visiting people because I don’t have enough clothes to pack for more than a day or two at a time. This is huge for me. I no longer have to cycle between sweatpants that make me heatsick and a frumpy, too-short pair of slacks. I. Have. Pants! And now if I decide to lose weight, it’ll be out of choice, and not out of absolute necessity of needing to be able to fit into clothes that won’t make me heatsick when I go outside.",happy,joy,88
"We just adore this and it put a smile on our face 😊 - Young Irish farmer's genius hack to keep calves entertained day and night The best way to keep happy calves is by providing them with hoppy entertainment, a young farmer says. Irish man and farmer Philip Stewart, 28, has come up with some creative ideas to keep his farm animals in high spirits.

His calves love to play with massive red space hoppers- which are usually used by children to bounce up and down on. The third generation farmer says toys that keep his animals occupied are paramount to their happiness.

He also fills small holed balls with hay so that the young cows have fun while feeding. The farmer, who has a Youtube channel documenting the antics of his family’s 400-acre farm, said: “Happy calves need enrichment, and the Temu space hopper - usually a children’s toy - is keeping the bulls entertained in the barn day and night.”

After completing his farming qualifications in 2016, Philip runs a farm with around 250 dairy beef calves. He wanted to put his own stamp on the family business - and one of his ideas was looking at different ways to acquire bulk products needed for its everyday running.

The farmer buys many supplies from online shopping platform Temu - including the space hoppers and hay balls. He also purchased products from the site that he found hard to access in the Irish midlands, such as a vaccine gun, 20 syringes and several bottles.

Philip said: “We use a large bag of syringes and bottles every week for multi-mineral shots and vaccines. But the local co-op usually sells vaccine consumables in batches of five or ten.

""We just need consumable quantities that work for our commercial scale – Temu had them and we got them fast. And when our dosing gun broke, we had spares ready to go. It was a lifesaver.

“Our friends and fellow farmers were sceptical at first, and now our friends are asking where we got everything.”",happy,joy,10
"A stranger paid for our meal like a generous ninja My family was on vacation this weekend in Palm Springs and we went out to dinner. The gentleman at the adjacent table noticed my husband's sportswear and said he used to live in our state, and we talked football for a while, then he and his son left and we said goodbye.

When we asked for the check for our meal 10 minutes later, we were told, ""It's been taken care of, tip and all."" 

To that sweet man, thank you for that! It seems unfair to exchange pleasant conversation for a free meal, but we will pay it forward. 

Go Vikes! (Without Aaron Rodgers!)",happy,joy,79

"Wanted to share how a simple incident answered the most difficult question I've had my entire life. Just realized what I want in life

Hi everyone. I am 23 M, been single all my life due to poor life choices and an unhealthy family setting but that's in the past. I've always run for stuff like it would complete me but never really knew what I actually wanted in life. 

Tried therapy and everything and the biggest question ever lingered - What did I truly want from life? 

The answer was seemed complex to me, maybe money, maybe fame, maybe attention and I ran in search of it - read books, watched videos on how to be a rizzler and some weird and embarrassing stuff then I met someone. We're not a thing atm but it made me realize what I wanted in life. 

The biggest question of my life was finally answered and it was something so simple I dismissed it casually but it was Love. 

Never got the love from my family that I needed nor from anyone else but this girl made me realize is that I do not crave superficial stuff but love and affection and someone to call my own. The post may seem cringe to many but I'm smiling while laying in bed with this thought in bed and happy that I finally found what I lacked in life. 

TLDR; Guy troubled entire life, doesn't know what he wants realized he needs love.",happy,joy,81

At the beginning they had asked the audience to hold their applause so that everyone could hear the names that were being called. But when my grandmother had her name called everyone in the stadium clapped and cheered for her.

"Hollow to happy - I once wished for overwhelming days like this Wanted to take a moment to appreciate my happy annoyance and overstimulation.

I had a really *really* long and tiring day today, filled with cooking for fun for me and my lil cousin (stuff that many people in the family stole bites from and appreciated!), getting exasperated with doing technical stuff like filling in attendance and marksheets for SO MANY students for my mother, finishing my remote work and talking to clients, going to an exercise class, being irritated but spending time selecting pictures with care and sending my friend fashion inspo tips and reels, so on, so on.

And I sat down, sighing like a character does in movies, who finally gets rest after a whole day of chaos. I saw the time at 3 pm, realised only less than half the day had passed, and it is just the afternoon. I had an epiphany - you do get what you prayed for.

From days that went by too fast and were too short because I'd either wake up late due to depression and anxiety and sleep through my troubles, or days where I'd simply finish them by watching the same five shows under my blanket with no outside interaction. Days when men I dated or friends who were too busy caused me anxiety or heartbreak, or disgust. Days back, when I attached self-worth to the little downvotes on random Reddit comments. None of this matters tbh now.

Now, (again), I finally have people to fuss over, work to do, so many plans that I have the privilege to cancel, unread messages to return in an overflowing inbox of relationships I've cultivated with love and happy migraines to get. This is what heaven feels like and damn it took years to get. I have no plans of letting it go. Ever.",happy,joy,9

"A small shoutout to a stranger who came into my life from nowhere and helped me feel like me again Just a bit of context, I’ve struggled with my weight, bloating, and just feeling *off* for years. I’d try strict diets, detoxes, and crazy workouts, and every time I ended up tired, hungry, and frustrated. I spent hours and hours online just to find some solutions, but they never worked, or, probably, I overdid them.

However, one day, just scrolling through Instagram and I found Tanvi Parikh and her page.  
She is a fitness and mindset coach, but her approach was different, no guilt, no extremes, just small, realistic changes. She helped me understand my body, build better habits, and finally ditch the all-or-nothing mindset.

For the first time in ages, I feel like *me* again.  
I have more energy. I’m not bloated all the time. I actually enjoy moving my body. And I don’t hate what I see in the mirror anymore.

It might seem like a small thing, but it’s brought me so much joy.  
  
If you are in the same boat, do not give up; better and happier days are coming.

I tried to fix it but couldn't. Sitting there not knowing what to do, I realised that the battle was lost, so I discreetly called for my girlfriend.

She came in to the bathroom, I looked her dead in the eyes and said:

So he said that he is now 2 weeks in advance and gave my sone two packs of tim tams and a bunch of other treats for the family. We caught up and loosely planned to catch up again tomorrow.",happy,joy,11

- We stopped for lunch and saw so many cute puppies, so many. It was so great seeing everyone with their pups walking around a country town.

"I saw a rare bass once and fell in love, so my partner tracked one down and drove half a day to get it for me! We're in the UK where driving half a day on your day off is considered a LOT of driving! 

I'm an ex-gigging guitarist who got super burned out and hasn't done anything musical in a while. I recently got into bass and it's rekindled a passion so I've been playing a cheapo bass a lot! Last year I'd seen a band use a Daisy Rock bass and I fell in love with how unique it was. They're no longer manufactured and the bass counterparts were always rarer than the guitars, but my partner managed to find one and go get it for me! It was meant to be a birthday present but he couldn't resist giving me it early. Feeling very special and loved, and having lots of fun!",happy,joy,322

"I think I am finally happy, I just experienced such a sudden but impactful change in my life I wouldn't say I felt unhappy, but for a long time I felt a lack of motivation and a lack of meaning in life, like I was an incomplete person who did well enough but knew there was room for improvement. I decided recently to do something about it and just wanted to see if there was anyone who had similar feelings about life who could be with me on my journey, like a close accountability partner, I tend to do better when I have someone like that I can confide in. I made a simple post just talking about the kind of person I am like my faults, and what I desire in someone. I was expecting harsh criticism, sly remarks, and I did certainly get it from people, since the idea of anyone wanting a feeling of love in their life seems to tick people off and make them say the worst online, but to my absolute surprise someone came to me and offered. I mean it has not been that long at all but just the gesture made me feel special, and she has already been so much more comfortable for me to talk to than a lot of other people, I genuinely feel like I can relax around her and we can just enjoy talking and getting to know eachother, it is a truly amazing feeling. I want to be a better person just because she is in my life now, and just the thought of her throughout my day makes me make better choices, I just am really satisfied with life right now. Just meeting the right person flipped a switch in me to want to change. I am truly grateful to her and while I feel like I don't know the right things to say (most of the time) or I am awkward, I feel like she doesn't have a problem with that and understands. I fear I scare people away because of how attached I can feel, but I feel like it is mutual this time around. I don't know a lot about her yet but I think that feeling of walking into the unknown is exciting, putting my trust into someone and not doubting at all, and I want to get to know more about her day by day like uncovering a mystery. I think this may be the most i've ever been effected by a person in such a short amount of time, it's exhilarating for me. Words fail to express the happiness I feel right now, how content I am with the way things are. Anyways.. Just needed that off my chest, I obviously cannot send a 40 page document to her describing every facit of emotion I am feeling, but I figured others may benefit from this and it may be a motivation to them to brighten their day \^-\^",happy,joy,23

"I experienced a random act of kindness today at McDonald’s ☺️😎 So, cool thing happened after I got off of work today. I went through the drive thru of McDonald’s to get something to eat and I noticed that the car in front of me didn’t stop to order something at the intercom, he just skipped it and went to the paying window. I thought it was odd but decided to just forget about it. I ordered my food through the intercom and when I got to the paying window it turns out the person in the car in front of me paid for my food. I really didn’t expect that to happen, I told the employee that I would still like to pay for my food because it just felt wrong not to. The employee talked to the manager to see what they would do and said that If I wanted to I could pay for the person behind me in line. I agreed to it. As I got to the window to receive my food I noticed in my side mirror the people behind me thanking me, I waved back at them. It was a nice experience but I only wish that I got to say thank you to the individual who paid for my order. ☺️",happy,joy,115

"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",depression,sadness,2366
"Regular check-in post, with essential information about our rules and resources Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you're having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, or have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these aren't allowed standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule),  this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are very different from most of the rest of reddit!  Since all of them exist for important reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several resource wikis for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support  (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal issues. Grief, sadness, anger, loneliness and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",depression,sadness,26
"Seeing someone on here say “I wish I had cancer” and reacting to it as a cancer survivor I can’t remember if it was this sub or another but it was a person saying they wish they had cancer, and it upset a lot of people (understandably). 
But as a cancer survivor I wanted to say I kind of get it. When I was diagnosed it kinda made sense, it felt like all of a sudden I was “allowed” to feel the way I feel whereas before I was just someone who was failing in life (I was 22 at the time) probably depressed, CPTSD and undiagnosed autistic (which I didn’t know at the time). So if anyone ever feels like that I just wanted to say I get you. And coming from a not so warm family I needed the cancer as an “excuse” to care about my mental health. And the craziest thing is the psychological issues I dealt with before, during and after cancer were SO much worse than the cancer itself for me. When I had cancer I felt like I finally had a diagnosis that “lived up” to how I actually felt inside.",depression,sadness,129

I told them I have been feeling shit for over a year now and I have only been getting worse. I told them the alcohol is a last resort, and I do it instead of suicide. I have told them how I have been planning to kill myself and how, with carbon monoxide poisoning. They just told me they hate me and they wish I would kill myself. I have been hurt really really bad by there comment. Like at the time I'm at my lowest, they dont even sympathize instead just putting another hole in the sinking ship. Man I just need a hug but I don't have no one. And this shit cuts deep to Because one of them has been a friend since kindergarten.

Or like a way to get access and the courage to shoot myself or something, the world is grim, i don't see it getting any better, so please, have mercy on me, i had suicidal thiughs since probably 8 or 9 years old, and these it has been getting worse, please, just tell me how to kill myself, i don't need to be saved, i just don't want to live",depression,sadness,25

I'm unable to save, buy what I want as in food, visit my partner because I'm unable to afford the expenses.

I might lose my sanity just by applying for jobs, browsing for any openings etc etc and sitting around at home. 

I've got no friends, not that I need any. I can't even get myself to watch YouTube or a movie because I feel guilty of just sitting around doing nothing.

I attend interviews, no response. Apply for jobs, no response. I'm getting old and there's age limit too in some applications. My life is so messed up.

So i've been on Sertralin for a few months and i wanted to know what the side effects that often occur are? 

Personnally i feel very tired (i couldn't get out of day today because i felt dizzy and has huge vertigo). It's very new to me as i haven't been taking meds before. It's also annoying because i feel like i can't get up to my loved ones' expectations. The medication also made me  feel so desperate i SHed (i've never done that before). It also gives me muscle twiches that can lead to pretty bad muscle pain, often in my lower back. I also lost a lot of interest in food and feeding myself. 
On the sexual side, i feel like it's almost impossible to get orgasms now. It's pretty bad for me as sex was one if the last thing that made me feel a bit of relief. 

If somebody is willing to share what their side effects are or tell me if all of that is normal i would really appreciate it <3 thanks in advance and good luck with yall's recovery",depression,sadness,5
"I don't know what to feel anymore I am a terrible person who doesn't deserve to say they're depressed. I have two sisters who I bullied since we were little, now one avoids me and one hates me. My father is at best annoying and at worst abusive. My mother doesn't really do much except watch the news since she's so fed up with me and my sisters. I have sexual thoughts about my friends. I'm obsessive. I guess I'm smartish but I never challenge myself, like I should be working on homework but instead I'm typing this. Everyone around me seems so talented and kind, while I'm a fake, mean, and idiotic person. I would end myself if I weren't scared of dying. I used to think I was empathetic but I just feel numb now. If any of my friends knew this about me they would leave. Oh and I have thought about murder. I don't deserve your attention, but am I right? Do I deserve to be happy?",depression,sadness,4
"How do I stop thinking about doing it? I don’t like being sober. I hate having to think. I’ve always been relatively smart (or at least I used to be), and I don’t enjoy living life. Even when I was very young, it always felt like a letdown. I’ve had hobbies or hyper-fixations, and sometimes they cycle back around, but they always end up feeling ultimately pointless. Most of them come from an underlying need — socialization, energy release, boredom — not real passion.

I don’t even know how to change it. I’ve started studying for a new degree — it's easy and fairly interesting — but I still can’t stay afloat. My parents want what’s best for me, but to them that means financial security. What I’m really searching for is some kind of fulfilment — or at least advice better than: *“You’ve got loads of time to figure it out.”* Because at this rate, no, I don’t.

I’ve got okay friends, lovely past relationships, a great family who love me (and can help financially if I ever truly need it), and I’ve had numerous hobbies I was decent at. But life just feels so pointless. More and more, it seems like the best options are either to win the lottery and get high on a beach every day until I don’t feel anything anymore — or kill myself. My friends and family are really the only thing stopping me. I could never inflict that pain on them, without them fully understanding why. It's almost as if I want to be euthanised and I want them to accept it and love me anyways.

I have a deep fear of being egocentric, and I feel guilty for wanting more out of life than just a job, a family, and a mortgage. I even feel guilty for posting this. I’ve never talked about this stuff in-depth with anyone before. Most people seem like they’re just waiting for their turn to speak. I guess the silver lining is I’m seeing a psychiatrist soon — someone who will at least be paid to listen, rather than pretend to care before switching back to talking about how shitty their back feels or what they saw on the way to work. Sorry if there's any grammatical errors or stuff doesn't make sense.

Edit: 24 M\* This also sounds a lot like a career issue but, the only time I ever feel I'm happy is when I'm warm, cosy, high, falling in and out of sleep.",depression,sadness,4
"Is the purpose of arranged marriage is only to have kids? I really wanted to get married. But I don't want to have kids. There are so many options to have kids. We can adopt too right? I'm scared of my life. I want a partner to roam, share feelings, etc... but don't want to have kids. I'm stressed for my life. I'm having these negative thoughts and shivering, random panics. I really don't want to face all these stuff. Need to keep full stop for God's sake. I'm tired. I tried telling my parents about my wish. They are against me. I'm feeling stressed always with these negative thoughts etc. What should I do? I'm scared.",depression,sadness,6

"“Guy” “Friend” I (25F) hooked up with my guy best friend and I’ve told him multiple times that I only see him as a friend, but somehow he’s always convinced me to hook up with him. I want to just cut him off and not speak to him and I feel like I have a right to do that. He’s been shit posting about me on Facebook and I’m not sure what I did, I really don’t care and just don’t want to speak to him. But he’s my only friend and it makes me sad. But at the same time I know a try guy friend would not try to hook up with you and then ghost you after. I honestly think it’s fucked up because he’s close with my family and everything and I ended up telling my family and they told me to cut him off. He messaged me and I’m not going to reply. I know it takes two to tango but he knew what he was doing and it make me sick. How do I handle this without getting sad or lonely?",depression,sadness,3
"I don’t want to do it anymore I suffer from anxiety since I’m a teenager due a traumatic childhood and became expert with hiding my emotions.
When I became 23 it started to get worse and started to take antidepressants .
I’m seeing therapist since I’m 13 , when I was 24 I started to use drugs heavily, I tried any drug available in my country besides opioids till I crashed really hard.after that I went to a farm for people with depression to help to them to build a routine ,finished there and started to use drugs more than before till I went to rehab. I’m one year after rehab I’m 27 today and started collage this year. I finished the first semester while suffering all the time feeling so lonely and stressed and now I can’t do anything, I have gaps in all of the courses , I can barley eat,  can’t get out of bed just crying most of the days alone .
I don’t want to do it anymore the only reason I’m alive is because my family cares so much about me and I can’t hurt them like that but I really losing the desire to live as time pass. I feel like a complete failure and nobody can see it.
I look like an impressive man , I’m tall and good looking , smart and funny but it doesn’t worth shit if most of the time I’m just feeling pain .
I’m so sick of it the only reason I’m not doing drugs anymore is because they’re not working . I just want someone or something to take my pain away I don’t want to live anymore",depression,sadness,10
"Worst depression/anxiety of my life I left school cause my family forced me to come home after I wasn’t sleeping or eating. I am almost finished a MSC and have no motivation to finish. I feel incompetent, stupid, and broken. I will eventually run out of money. It feels like my friends dont care anymore, when I know they do. I think about suicide every day. I feel shaky, I feel weak, I feel like giving up. The only thing keeping me going is what little faith I have left in me in God, and the song Glory by our last night. Yes even those with faith in something more feel like giving up. I just dont know what to do. Everyone tells me just wait it just get yourself better but those are not answers. I just want to die.",depression,sadness,4
"i’ve lost the passion for everything. i used to love art. i can’t do it anymore. i loved music, now it feels meaningless. i love my cat, my mom. but i find no joy in life. no purpose for my future, no reason to exist. i can’t get into college because of my low academic scores due to brain damage. i can’t work due to disability. i don’t earn money for disability. i’m a burden to my mom who cares for me.

the black hole in my chest is back. it’s growing and sucking in everything keeping me alive. i hydrate only to dehydrate through my tears. 

“you’re worth it.” “you’re not alone.” “someone loves you.” it doesn’t fill the hole. nothing does. 

i wonder when the hole will finally consume the fear of the unknown. i wonder when i will make the jump. i have so many options at my fingertips, so many outs. i live near a bridge. i take medications that can be deadly. i have an extremely high pain tolerance, i’ve never needed opioids or even ibuprofen for post surgery. 

sometimes, someone will never contribute to society, to a family, to friends. 

i believe that someone is me.",depression,sadness,25
"Is goal setting a sunk cost fallacy? I'm always conflicted whether a simple to do list is beneficial or not. I tick it off as I go along but hardly even bother to do what needs to be done.

Sometimes I complete the odd task then tick it off like booking an appointment for instance, but mostly this is automated when I can be arsed without even looking at the list of things that needs done.

It subconsciously places me into a mindset of having to 'plan my every action'. So I put things off that may help because its simply not on my priority list. This is obviously not the way to approach life, to be reliant on planning ahead of every goal as it goes against spontaneous action.'

I need to get out more as I'm a serious recluse even during warm weather. Today I ventured out of my cave to get a trim, it felt good to just simply walk in the sun for a brief moment because a day out for me is usually opening the windows and blinds, that's as close as I get. I wish I could be better at making goals and taking action, 

I get so overwhelmed with thinking what career path to take for instance so I instead do nothin but wallow. Its been a constant frustration for me that has plagued my life, keeping me locked in this dangerous cycle of rumination which depression feeds upon, I'm sure u guys can relate to this twisted paradox.",depression,sadness,2

"Update on me (21M) and my situation has progressively gotten worse, I'd like to know how to turn my life around. About 4 months ago in January/ late December I had made a post on reddit also asking for advice about a breakup I was going through. trying not to restate the whole post, long story really short, basically I was broken up with, and I don't know why, I can speculate all day, but it's just not helping me, by doing that. the post attracted one person to comment some supporting words which I did not forget about, appreciate and did take to heart, saying that I need to keep going and keep eating, stay healthy etc. 

So, update since then, the good parts, I started taking medicine to help with anxiety and depression, with that I picked up a new hobby or if I'm honest, something to distract me, motorcycling riding. that's about all for the good, on the other hand, I lost my job, I'm in debt from taking out loans which I could pay if I kept my job, I'm stressed out with my family members medical issues, and to keep it brief, I feel stressed, every day I wake up

Relationship wise, I'm stuck I feel as if it's Wrong to move on as I put everything, I had into her, and to let go of the memories we had, but I know I couldn't and wouldn't take her back if she texted me today, because of the pain it put me through. By now, I thought with my combined efforts of deleting all social media reddit included, not looking back at past pictures and thinking about the times we spent together, my attempts to medicate, lack of communication to her, and self-allowance, knowing I'm going to have bad days, then better ones, that I would eventually grow past this person, and hardships I'm going through. But, I haven't, I don't know if this is normal or not, to not be over someone in about 4 months or so that you knew for years, regardless how this all ties together is, I was unable to focus at work, not motivated enough to go out and talk to more people, and my mood was constantly down. consequently, I was fired, and I just sat there, freaking out inside, unbothered on the outside.

Professional wise, I'm too stuck in my own head that can't compartmentalize work from personal, and i end up spacing out, and it causes me to make mistakes, and sometimes not even remember them. leaving the only thing I can say is ""I don't remember what happened"" like I'm on auto pilot 99% of the time. I need a new job now of course, and I been searching ever since, but I don't even know if it will turn up like the last one I had, as it seems to be a bigger issue than I originally let on.

Family and personal wise, I put these 2 together because some of this is me overthinking, some is true with losing my job I had to move back in with my parents, which I didn't want to do as I hate feeling that I leech off them. I offered to pay rent with the money I have saved, my mom declined taking it. my stepdad made some comments about how old I am coming back to live with them is ridiculous and that I should figure it out on my own. which only makes feel that I'm letting them down.  The meds I been on haven't been working as well as when I was first given them, then again to someone who's so used to feeling abnormal, normal is the weird feeling, if that makes any sense...

Anyway, I don't want to feel as if I failed, relationship wise, professional wise, family wise, and personal wise.",depression,sadness,3

This year a few weeks after christmas i discovered my father was cheating on my mum, he confessed to her and they have stayed together. 
This effected me greatly and I have been attending therapy since before this happened. I canceled my last appointment as nothing seems to help. Im constantly disgusted by my dad and so sad for my mum who deserves the absolute world.

"Honestly it’s not worth it to live If u don’t have an amazing career to make money with, or don’t have a job you love what’s the point. Work and half of your money is gone just finding a place to live. After 23 love is about what u can provide and becomes transactional so it’s really not love.

"This illness literally controls everything in my life I've been depressed for 3 years and counting. I don't think I'll stop counting any sooner. 

1. I cannot sleep when I feel like because every night is filled with insecurity, trust issues, guilt for existing and more and more ideas to kill myself. Thoughts control when I get to sleep. 

2. When I wake up is also controlled by depression. Since I have such a bad headache by afternoon every day I need to wake up early to start studying early. And my sleep isn't great because hey someone is in the darkness watching you and ghosts and nightmares idk what else. Migraine and dizziness sucks. 

3. How much I eat also is dependent on this because I have so much pain in my throat every time I try swallowing something. It is GERD and the only reason at my age to have it is because of some mental illness. 

4. How I talk to people is controlled by it because I just feel guilty for them having to be near someone like me, having to talk to someone as disgusting as me, someone as lazy and selfish as me. I want to escape from everyone. Run away kill myself not have to face anyone. Otherwise I'll have to be as silent as I can while literally screaming from inside and appear as if I'm the happiest person on this planet. 

5. How much I can concentrate, how I can communicate is controlled by it. I have to talk to patients in the hospital, if I live long enough I'll be a doctor in the next 1 year. I cannot study properly forget about retaining material. Concentration, the will, the desire, the interest, everything is gone. I cannot communicate with patients well because my mind works literally so slowly that I can barely follow what they say. Normal speed is too fast for me with all the dissociation. 

Do I want to get better? Honestly no because even if there is a slightest possibility of me getting better, I am not a good person, I'm gonna relapse very quickly and I'd never wanna be where I am now.

People say: ""The only way out is through"". The only way out is to escape and get over.",depression,sadness,4

I STILL feel this way. I have not changed since I was 17. I still fantasize about killing myself every day. I think that if my sister didn’t die when we were kids I would have done it or at least tried it by now. I don’t know if I will ever not be in pain.

"help hi guys so ive been thinking abt taking my life away because ive never been happy with my life although i have everything that would make a girl happy. but since i was a kid ive always cried at school and trainings and isolated myself and made my life like real hell. i dont remember anytime in my life where i really enjoyed it. and what'a hurting is that i really have everything any girl would want if its gold, cloth, trainings, like literally anything even brain and beauty. I've really tried to change the person who I am but I keep failing. I don't even know how to go to college anymore or study or go out of the house. I was never happy with my life since I was literally 7 or somth i even remember all my childhood has been depressive and I never used to say yes to plans and say my parents said no although they would always agree. I really dont know what to do pls pls could there be something with my brain??

like is really enjoying life a choice?

how?

i don't believe that because how could it be a choice and ive been like this ever since i was a small kid. Even while going out i used to see everything as dark or black. i dont know really what to do. i gave up on my life and myself. and everywhere i go like school, college, everyone seems to be really living and happy with their lives except me. its really not normal. could there be somth really wrong with how my brain functions. i really used toc cry and have sad notes written of how i dont have any friends although i used to have but my brain tends to do that and isolate myself. what can i do guys? i really need help

  
ive tried even pyshiatrict and whatever and therapy and i take meds but im still the same useless person i cant seem to do life anymore.

  
like how can i enjoy life??

ive always based my life on studying anf used to isolate myself from ppl all my life and close my phone to the point where i went college and got fed up from life and even not studying at all where i;ll prob fail this year.

  
and even when i was small and used to go out ive never enjoyed. all my pictures since i was young were even depressive . i think i was born to be doomed and cant imagine it in a different way.

  
if there was a scan or test that we could do to check how our brain works im pretty sure mine would be unbalanced or have like 90% percent depressed and doomed mind.

you guys dont understand its to the point where im sad i wake up everyday and i hide from ppl in college and i dont study like im not doing life/",depression,sadness,3
"I looked fine on the outside. Fun, successful, always “on.” But inside, I was in turmoil. I looked fine on the outside. Fun, successful, always “on.”  
But inside, I was in turmoil.

For 18 years, I drank every single day.  
At first, it helped me tune out the noise - quiet the anxiety, the overthinking, the ache I didn’t have language for.

But over time, what used to help became a poison.  
My body started rejecting it. My brain too.  
I didn’t know who I was anymore without something in my system.  
I was always caffeinated, buzzed, crossfaded, or crashing.

Eventually, the cracks showed:  
Three psych ward visits.  
An attempted suicide.  
Then finally, rehab.

It sounds ridiculous now, but realizing *“maybe it’s all the drinking”* was actually a breakthrough.  
Rehab didn’t just sober me up, I was a functioning alcoholic - it gave me my identity back.  
It helped me understand alcohol not as some harmless adult beverage, but as a drug that was destroying me slowly and quietly.

I wanted to share this story with you guys because I’ve also decided to take action.  
I don’t think the public really knows how serious alcohol is; that it causes cancer, addiction, worsens mental health, and contributes to suicide.

So I created a petition asking Congress and the Alcohol & Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau to update the Surgeon General’s warning label on alcohol to reflect what science now confirms, and what too many of us learned the hard way.

I’ve never led anything like this before. It’s just me and some LLMs trying to build something real. If you feel the truth might’ve helped you (or someone you care about) I’d be grateful if you signed: [https://www.change.org/LabelTheTruth](https://www.change.org/LabelTheTruth)

I was really hard working and driven, I had a hobby that I got paid for, I've traveled the world, been with a ton of women, and I've worked at some of the most prestigious institutions in the world....but now all of that is gone, and I feel completely burnt out.   
  
Now, I actively try not to speak with people and In a weird way, I'm almost content with how empty my life is. I didn't think I'd feel this way so soon.  I can still go outside, exercise, enjoy a beautiful day....  
  
But I've fallen out of love with life and I'm not taking any steps to improve myself and that's frustrating to admit. I know I'm probably just wallowing in self pity, hence why I think I have nothing to share. Even when I'm invited out to things, I usually choose not to go.   
  
Most the time I feel like I'm just better off rotting away alone.",depression,sadness,2
"This is my last night I don’t know where to start. But at least i know where it ends. All I’ve known my whole life is pain, suffering, heartache, and loneliness. I put in so much work to continually better myself, love myself, accept myself. I exhaust so much effort into making others around me happy. I always show up yet never shown up for. I always listen but can never be heard. I’m constantly falling short in every aspect in life. I’m a shell of the human i once was. Nothing brings me joy, pleasure, happiness. Only sadness and anger. I remember what it was like to be happy. Barely. But the distant feeling of wonder, and excitement is so far out of reach that it only exhausts me more trying to catch it. I’ve spent so many years breaking down my walls, making myself more vulnerable, trying to be a better man. To feel normal in a crowd. To feel loved by their peers. I thought i was there. But the reality was that I’ll never be there. There will always be something holding me back. Someone to take away the hope. The things i hope for never come true, and i think the reason ive suffered for this long is because all i can remember is how often ive hoped for this life to end. Maybe its because the things i hope for will never come along. Maybe my life hasn’t ended because then I’ll be in a better place and for some strange reason the universe wants me to keep crawling through this darkness. Death is the one thing i hope for anymore. But maybe hope isn’t enough to put me at peace. This isn’t a cry for help. My mind has been made up. Don’t waste the energy to change my mind or my outlook. I don’t blame anyone for who I’ve become. Please don’t blame yourself.",depression,sadness,0

"I think I’m mad Today I woke up with different anxiety that I  usually feel. My dog woke me up, and the Sun was up, so I guessed I over slept and I let my dog out. She didn’t even need to use the bathroom. She barked at me until she came back inside. 

How long her bark was in that moment and how everything felt so bright and disorienting made me feel super weird. 

When she came back inside, I took myself to bathroom thinking maybe I needed to use the restroom. Sometimes I don’t understand when I need to go and different feeling when reality it’s just poop. (That’s ADHD thing according to my last psychiatrist) 

I came back out and just laid down. But I’m shaking. I scroll through social media to distract myself and it’s not working. All I want to do is go into the shower and scrub off my skin with a pumas stone. 

I think maybe I was mad bc my routine was disrupted",depression,sadness,2
"The hardest part for me is that every time I try to do something to feel better mentally, it ends up feeling pointless. I just get hit with more disappointment. If I had to describe depression, I’d say it’s not just something that kills you slowly from the inside. It also kills anything you think might help you heal. It’s like this loop you’re stuck in. You try over and over to get out, but somehow you always end up back at square one.

Honestly, I think people who want to die don’t actually want death. They just want that loop to stop. They just want peace from the never-ending cycle.",depression,sadness,1

"Overwhelmed, stressed.. and so lost. TLTR;
 I've been living in the States for about 5 years now. I moved here for my fiance since his family is here. At first I loved it! A different scenery, a chance to start over and be new. But now I just miss everything about home. Slowly the past 2 years I've been missing home, more and more.

 Now I just feel an anger inside, I feel like I missed so much. My cat died, that really got me, I loved that cat, my parents were taking good care of him. Then a very close friend of mine passed, and I wasn't there and couldn't even make it to the funeral. My parents are getting older, a part of me is always worried to get a call that something happened to one of them. My friends back home all went through something and I feel like I can't support them as well as I'd like too. 

 I'm just here. I've been the only one working for 5 months, rent is expensive! Then the bills.. and food.. I don't even like thinking about what to have for dinner anymore, I dread that question. Everything just stresses me out so badly, I don't know how to deal with my emotions anymore. I have been going to the gym, that seems to be the only thing keeping me somewhat sane. 

 I just also can't stand the people now, all these small things get to me and I know they shouldn't, but they do. Just driving to work this morning my spotify wouldnt connctect. Or it just kept disconnecting, anyways it was was a point I just started balling my eyes out. I just want music. Everything feels against me, I feel like I'm drowning, and breathing exersizes dont seem to help, I just want to cry more. I just want to rip my hair out and scream. I don't know how to deal with this, any hobby I have I've lost interest. I love video games, but of course, my friends only all either don't like each other or lately super passive aggresive, makes me hate playing games with anyone..

My fiance is amazing, and I love him! Don't get me wrong, he does make me so happy and fortunate to be with someone like him. He's gone through a lot as well, at first when he quite his job I was and still 100% with him and will support him, but it's been 5 months.. I'm struggling to keep up with everything. He knows it too, he's been looking for work but because of previous jobs he had a back injury, he's having a hard time find work. He had quite a few interviews but no call backs. He's stressed and depressed, I'm stressed and depressed. 

 I'm trying my best to keep it together, I miss my family, I miss the support, I miss my old community. This place sucks. The people suck, I used to love the food now I'm bored and hate it. I've gained so much weight, I hate how I feel and look. It's the biggest I've ever been in my life, it's so embarrassing and humiliating. Everything feels against me, everything is so overwhelming I don't know what to do or think anymore, I'm scared. I'm worried all the time. I hate this, this feeling is horrible, I'm just lost. So damn lost. 


Sorry that this is long, and probably all over the place, I just needed to write it down, say something because there's nothing else I feel like I can do. I love and hate my life right now. I'm an mess.  I hope others don't ever feel this way, it's a horrible feeling. Has anyone else gotten through this feeling? Just anything, any words. Any person.",depression,sadness,1
"Advice for Relative with Depression Hello community.

I need some advice from you, because I, or rather my brother, am facing a big problem.

My brother (29) has had severe depression for about 3 years now (I think it runs in our family) and he can't get out of it despite regular therapy. He repeatedly has the feeling of not being worth anything and not being able to do anything, which leads to extreme fears about the future, feelings of powerlessness and no proper sleep (he says he sleeps a maximum of 4 hours a night, although he goes to bed around 22:00, but can't fall asleep).

For context: He works in our family business in the construction industry (which I also worked in but managed to leave). The industry is very tough and the family situation, especially with our father, who is otherwise loving and does everything for us, is very difficult to work with and always shakes his self-esteem anew. After a 2-year sabbatical and therapy, things went well again for a while, but a few days ago everything escalated again and he couldn't help but start crying. The mental stress he is under causes him to make mistakes and lack energy, which of course fuels the vicious circle.

In my opinion, the job in our family business doesn't play to his skills and he needs to do something else to prove his abilities and rebuild his self-confidence.

He somehow knows this too, but he can't find the strength to change anything (I know the feeling of permanently overwhelming tiredness).

I would like to get him to support him on his way out of the company and get him into an activity (possibly volunteering with the Red Cross) so that he sees that he is not worthless or without ability and to get to know other people and ways of life

What tips/procedures/strategies would you have for me so that I can get him on this path and support him? (because he needs help here, he can't do it alone) 
If anyone has experienced this, what has helped you and what have you done?

Thank you in advance",depression,sadness,1

I can’t keep struggling like this I don’t know much longer I can keep going Hello I just turned 24 but I still can’t seem to dig my way out of this hole and it actively feels like I’m being buried in it. A three long abusive relationship ended about a year ago it left my homeless I had no family to go to for support and my friends live 100s of miles away I signed a lease with a friend of mine back in September and have been financially drowning ever since I’m in so much debt on top of student loans I can’t feed myself most days and my car is on a downward spiral creating a money pit I can’t feed anymore. It was my grandpas car who had died three years and has been my safe space ever since. I have a mood disorder that has been becoming harder and harder to control even on medication and I’m in therapy due to the stress causing me to constantly self sabotage and spend recklessly because I genuinely think I’m going to off myself during the next depressive episode. My grandma has had two strokes and I fear for her life everyday as she has been my only rock recently. My mom died due to a relapse roughly a week ago I told her I wanted to rebuild our relationship once I had my life together and now I’ll never have that and I didn’t get the chance to tell her I loved her one last time I’m filled with so much regret. I haven’t paid April rent and they expect this week. I’m constantly isolated here besides my job that has continued to cut my hours (I work at Target and we all know what’s happening) more and more often I think it would be easier to just die so I don’t have to live like this anymore.,depression,sadness,1
"I Don’t Know What to Do I have been suffering from depression since I was 11 years old, and I will be 17 this year. I don’t know how I am going to live past 18 at this point. I have nothing I am passionate about–at least not to the extent of having a full time job surrounding it–I have difficulty concentrating on my schoolwork–which I do online–and I spend just about every moment wishing I was dead. Even when I am feeling “good”, I still don’t want to be alive since I reason to myself: ”I feel just fine now, so I should close the book now before it gets worse so I can end this miserable symphony on a high note.” No, perhaps this reasoning serves merely as a justification for emotions I would have had regardless of my conscious thoughts. The worst part about all of this is that I have no idea why I feel this way. 

I heard from a psychologist on YouTube that it’s a good exercise to imagine what circumstances around you would need to change in order to be happy. Apparently, doing this can be a useful tool to help a despondent person to ascertain whether their feelings are caused by the outside world, or whether they are simply brought about by an ailment of the mind. Interestingly, the only world I imagine myself happy is one devoid of people and responsibilities, made complete with a basalt-gray aesthetic throughout the land, grey cloudy skies, and tower for me to inhabit with a vast library spanning the fields that interest me. Not only is this wildly unrealistic, but I may end up not even being satisfied if this fantasy ever did become a reality.

I feel so disgusting all the time. No matter how much I shower I can't wash it off. This world is disgusting. I don't want to exist in a place I don't belong. It was always blatantly clear I wasn't meant to exist anyways. I never had a single friend, never done a thing in my life.

True friendship is dead or is it me According to Facebook I have made some friends which I can usually add to the list every time I am hanging out by myself in the city by making little effort. However almost none of these people I thought my friend I see again and usually make no desire for sustained text conversations. Occasionally a new friend is agreeable and can be visited in person a couple more times until the eventual radio silence. I don't have any friends from childhood or college so this is most unfortunate. I am not really the church going type however trying to convince my lady but she is young and still likes to party with her girl friends while not coming home sometimes until next day or two but I trust her and have no worries about infedility. So anyway I always seem to be in perpetual loneliness and do get depressed which therapy barely mitigates. I love my girlfriend and happy she is not friendless like me. Maybe it is only a matter of time for when she does not come back any more and then it will be just me and the Lord nobody else.

"I'm an idiot. Hi all.
I know it's a long post, sorry about that.
If you have any questions I'll probably be happy to answer them below.

I'm 22, living at home.
My life is an unending series of disasters.

People have always said I'm a hot head and I have problems with authority. That's just not the case. Recently 2 or 3 people have even used the word aggressive to describe me or how I come accross. I think that is because my breaking down has really started approaching critical levels in the last 1-3 years.
(I'm not some aggressive beast who yells at people, I promise.)

I have a problem with people who abuse me or others via their authority (it's pretty common if you open your eyes).
I didn't get on well in primary school was always messing and in trouble and talking back to teachers etc. 
I'm smart and was raised well, largely avoiding physical fights, never bullied others, treating women well and so on and so forth.
Secondary school was no better. I moved with my mum from my home town to the capital and left my dad behind. 
In school I managed to conduct the first year fairly normally but by second year cracks were showing. By third year I had started skipping school, smoking, drinking and lots of dating. Covid hit in 5th year at which point I dropped out (not having a crystal ball to tell me about predicted grades, would have probably stayed if I knew I could get a reasonable grade with minimal work).

Started working full time around then and since then have been in and out of jobs up to now. 6 months working here, 2 months wasting time and nulling emotions there, and so on. 
I did survive 6-12 months in a few places but most of my employment has ended within 3-4 months for one reason or another. During 2020 to say 2022 ish, it felt easy to go from one place to another. I barely had to apply to a handful of places before I'd have another job offer. It's changed since then, and I've had a terribly hard time finding work. And the work I have found has been consistently lower quality (albeit always the same minimum wage pay). Think going from a grocery store -> nice office environment -> back to poxy retail.

I'm not qualified for anything in any way other than retail really. I am hoping to start a course in the next few months which if I am successful will enable me to go and work in the field I want to work in. (After 18 months of getting through the course on a minimum wage job (if I can even find a new job))

I recently lost my job while still in probation period.
It was brutal. It was unfair. Unwarranted. And it came from a manager who did everything to pretend they were my friend. (Trust me, I've now begun internalising the idea that nobody at work is my friend.) And it came just days after a devastating medical diagnoses for one of my parents, which I had shared just days before with that same manager who had told me how hard it was for them when their parent had a similar very serious health problem. (I wonder how much harder it would've been for them if they got f***ed out of their job during such a time...)

I've never seriously studied anything, other than light research in personal time into all the various things I thought I was interested in before realising they were way too ambitious and/or unrealistic.

I'm really struggling right now. I have no savings. I have no job. I have no qualifications. I have no career. I have no friends (except some who are far far away living their own happy lives). I've never achieved anything in my life. 
One parent is gravely sick and I am taking public transport the length of the country every other day to act as a caretaker for them. My friends have gone to different countries to pursue their careers and more.
I just feel like a massive fuckup every second of every day because I am and I want change but the realities of this world make me think it isn't worth living through. If I did decide to take my life I would probably go on a 'holiday' and go missing or something.

I'm lonely. I'm tired. I have nothing to show for any/all of the effort I've ever given anything. I'm struggling to use logic to form reasons I shouldn't give up. 

I haven't dated in 2.5 years and my confidence in all aspects not just romantically has never been lower.

I don't know if I can start fresh or rebuild from these foundations or lack thereof.

I have no more money for food, travel, haircuts etc so I am living off my family. It feels shitty. I should have my own money. I should have a car and a life like my friends do. But I don't. Because I may not be a hot head but I sure do come across that way when I am faced with utter bullshit.

Don't know how to end this post but thank you for taking the time to read or reply.

I know things could be obviously worse but at the same time, I hope it's not selfish to say that that doesn't help me, and my life certainly isn't a walk in the park.",depression,sadness,1
"Why Do I Keep Trying? Every time I try to change, I prove once again that I am incapable of any such thing. I can't be better. I only get worse. I'm a liar. I'm lazy.

You know what would really happen? The lies stop. No more fighting with my brother. You no longer have to put up with my bullshit. You already ignore my mental health and you have two other kids who aren't as useless as I am. My family's better off without me.",depression,sadness,2
"I don't feel comfortable in my own skin I'm 19M and since I was a kid I have anxiety and self esteem issues, the type of when I was 6 years old I was already anxious to be with other kids in a daycare.

my parents never realized I'm this way, they think I am a stupid ass guy who doesn't care about anyone and do things like talking in a lower tone almost mumbling on purpose, or that I'm just very very very lazy when I don't want to go out solve something by myself, it's definitely not a excruciating lack of self esteem and me wanting to kill myself over my looks.

they really think I'm pretending or even most likely they don't even know I go through this since kindergarten, I do blame on them cuz they are two pieces of shit who think they do all is needed to have a functional son just because they feed me and offer habitation, but I know it's not their only fault, it's not their fault I was born with such an ugly face, hair and the most unsocioalizable mind that has ever happened to exist.",depression,sadness,1

"I've screwed myself (extortion, witchcraft and so on) Notes: I speak Spanish, so I use a translator. Sorry for any spelling errors. This is an account I don't use, so I hope I'm not putting myself at risk. 

I (19 M) need help. This can be summed up as: I looked for trouble, created a problem, and now I'm panicking about the consequences of the problem I created. 

I am someone who believes in magic, logically I am not mentally well (lol), and a few days ago I was curious to know what it would be like to be bewitched or ""amarrado"" (latinamerican) So I googled a witch. I remember her page well because it had a gothic font and it caught my attention. I contacted her and paid her some money. Basically, I didn't have to do anything until we had a video call, you see, I was expecting weird candles and a weird spell, but in the video call he showed a ""voodoo"" doll of me and the person (I'll explain what happened later), I panicked when I saw that and his altar since it looked a little creepy and I just stopped thinking. When he mentioned that he would send me a package (she had my brother's address, because I gave it to him while I was shocked) with a medallion, the box with the voodoo and animals for me to kill them and bury them in a cemetery. She then mentioned that she could do it for a price, and I didn't really listen after that. I order her to cancel everything, and she told me it would have to be around $770 USD for that or they would tell the boy what he tried to do to him,  I hung up, blocked her, and deleted the chat (though it may not have been deleted entirely, I'm not good at this things). 


I confessed to my brother everything that happened, he was obviously upset and I'm scared that he's messed up everything, our years-long bestie relationship, the possibility of moving out, and his safety, I also had to confess it to his partner, because I had screwed them both. 

After a couple of hours, the ""leader"" showed me a video of the video call without my consent. In this video, I appear saying part of the ""spell"" I mentioned:  If I don't do this, I will give you the most beloved thing (to you, Saint Death). It was meant to embarrass me even more, but it was a stupid move, since in that video call his ""disciple"" revealed the killing of animals and even suggested stealing to get the money. She (the leader) also tried to roast me in a group of witches, saying, ""Does anyone know this guy? He opened a dangerous portal and now he could die, also I'm looking for the other one."" She showed it to me saying that I should pay her $500 USD to not say anything to the boy and to ""close the portal."" 

The boy the spell was directed at wasn't even interesting to me, I only put him in because he was the only boy whose full name I remembered. But even that makes me see what a terrible person I was being. 

This was two days ago (as I write this it's the third) and since then I haven't stopped feeling anxious, everything feels so unreal, and I've had suicidal thoughts again, which I haven't had since months ago. At this point, I don't want to kill myself or continue thinking about it, but I don't know what to do. He knows my full name, the man's name, my address, and my brother's and my phone numbers. 

I've been researching various forums to see what's done in these cases, but none of them screwed up as much as I did, or even worse than I did. So I decided to post my own case.",depression,sadness,1
"Life isn’t fair I genuinely think that one of the biggest misconceptions we grow up with is the belief that life is fair. And as I grow older, as I become an adult, I realise that it’s not true.

The thing is, that some people are lucky. Some get the chance to realise their deepest dream, meeting their forever person, professional success, getting rich, whatever success looks like for them. But unfortunately, others out there have a string of bad luck after bad luck. Getting sick, losing the only person you care about, losing your job… the list goes on.

I’m not saying that success depends only on luck, no. Sometimes, you really do have to put in the work. But again, unfortunately, you can work as hard and as smart as possible and still fail. You could be a good-hearted person, do everything right and still end up with a miserable life. While, out there, this bad person, seems to be living the perfect life.

Life isn’t fair. And guess what ? I think it is okay. Maybe you should adjust your hopes and dreams based on what you have. You can't change the direction of the wind, but you can adjust your sails. Go with the flow and adapt to the situation in front of you. Because I truly think some people spend more time complaining than taking action.

I just wanted to share this. Maybe it will help someone, like it helped me.  
It’s okay to fail where others succeeded. It’s okay to let go of that childhood dream. Live your life the way you want, because it’s yours — as long as you're not hurting anyone or doing something illegal, of course. And especially for those in this subreddit: you already have your mental illness to deal with, so don’t add more weight to an already heavy load. *(And keep taking your meds, lol.)*",depression,sadness,1
"My wife doesn't understand why her and my son are not enough I've been numb and depressed since I was roughly 12 years old. That's when I had my first suicidal ideation. Even medicated, I think constantly about ending it all. There's just no point to this rat race to just line some billionaires pockets. 

But my wife takes it personally. She feels like every time I come to her to confide my depression and ideation, that I'm basically saying her and my son aren't good enough to want to keep living for. I try to explain that this is just how my brain has always worked. Even now, being on enough pills to tranquilize a horse, I still think life isn't worth it. But I continue for them, because I know leaving them would make their lives infinitely worse and I could never do that to them.

It's just been so hard, losing my brother, losing bother my parents to cancer, when my mom was my previous reason for living before my wife and son. No matter what I do, there will always be that hole in my heart.

How do I explain to her that she is good enough, and that they're literally the only reason I am still alive? My wife has dealt with suicidal depression before, but she gaslit herself into being satisfied with life. But I just can't. My love for them is what keeps me going despite all the bullshit this life throws my way. I just wish she understood it's not something personal against her.",depression,sadness,1

I don’t have any plans to end myself but I’m in a place where I would welcome it if fate were to kill me. I’m just tired all the time. I come home from work and sleep just to go back to work and then come home again to take another nap. My partner points out alot of my flaws and I genuinely thought I was doing better but they notice I’m not and it creates tension in our home. I feel like i’ve given a lot to them just to be told it’s not enough. I feel like i’ve let my mom down. The only joy I find is video games and even then…they are starting to feel like nothing.

"I’m having a mental breakdown It’s fair to say that i’m slowly losing my sanity and having a mental breakdown

My special friend i lost around a year ago,all the people that i hurt and hurt me and the people that backstabbed me around that time

Many toxic people i met after the fact,i platform i was ousted from because of a 2 faced bitch who claimed to love me but only wanted to destory me

I’m even remembering people from my life from many years ago,people that still hurt like scars to this day…even someone important of my life that still comes back to my mind of this day


That person i was close with that’s not a shell of themselves…i always say i need a special person or i need to be surrounded by people to be happy but in actual fact…i think even if i had them now my mind would be terirating

I was on team fortress 2 with my friend earlier and all i was thinking about was revenge on a person that hurt me recently…other people that left scars on me…people heck that may still be around certain parts of interwebs

People that hate me,people that wont listen to me,people that make unfair judgements on me peoole that wont learn the truth people that wont hear me out

It’s all consuming and honestly i feel myself spriling to a point of contemplating my own life again…all these situations all these people…all these memories and thoughts are tearing me apart…are breaking me down…are making me to a point i don’t want to be here anymore

And i don’t know how to get these voices to shut up,how i get these people to leave my mind…how i get all this pain and baggage to go away…

Even in this post right here…what are they empty meaningless words…sure someone is reading them…but what difference does it make?

Sure give some words of comfort say everything will be fine…but if playing a game with one of my best friends that has been one of the few ways of escapism for awhile doesn’t even manage to work anymore what realistically will…there is even a huge match with my football team tonight that will literally decide the future or my club and i can’t even bring myself to focus on it

What will having the right person do…what will having the right people do…when all i can think about is the countless upon countless of people that despite and hate my guts and wont hear any different…

"doing nothing, help How do you stop doing nothing?

I recently was put on a combo that made me stop feeling so shit and suicidal, but the issue remains that my life has become a doom scrolling nightmare. I literally will sit for days in my bed just scrolling on anything, obsessing about bipolar and reading in Reddit trying to find a solution.


I am unable to keep a job for more than 2 weeks. 1 lost interest in almost everything. I wake up, scroll, eat breakfast, watch tv, scroll, shower, scroll, eat lunch, scroll, maybe tv again then sleep. I can't keep living like this. I feel like my days are wasted. I do have family, friends and also a boyfriend, but have not made efforts to deepen the connections. I am still applying for a job because I feel like it will help me break out of the cycle.

"I am getting better Whatever better is. I am depressed and have been that way for a long time. A lot of things have happened over the years. But for the sake of this post I had/have s*icidal ideation. I had a plan and a time and place. This is where I got better, a few years prior to turning 30 which is when I intended to d*e.

Because I had this plan in my head I pulled away from people. All people and while I didn't burn bridges. I did let them rot. For some I never bothered because I had an expiration date. At least I thought I did back then. Now I don't and am realising I never made any real connections. This depression and other issues started so young, I never tried to build relationships. I existed in my head a very very long time. Decades. 

And now I don't know how to build relarionships with people. I try but then I am just reminded of how broken I am when I try to keep a conversation going. Then I crawl back inside my own head where I built a safety bunker and hide behind jokes and the mask I built to function on automatic so no one sees me d*e a little inside.

Now I am here looking for advice on redit because therapists are expensive and I got nowhere else to go. (Obligatory haha)

I'm sorry. I didn't know. I was only scraping by because I thought suicide would hurt those around me, but I didn't realize that I was already hurting you.

"How to spot depression? This is pretty much that but with the details. 

Hi yall,

I’ve been noticing quite a few signs that I think are not normal. My partner has suffered with depression in that past and has made an attempt to before (around 14). Their room is never clean and as much as I dont mind much however it concerns me, they don’t shower often however do skincare every other night. They don’t ever wanna seem to go out and try avoiding getting out of the house as much as possible. They hate getting out of bed to do anything and either forget to eat or eat a meal a day. 
They do cook when I come around around twice per day for us to eat and make snacks through out the day for us as I have picked up on the low eating a while back due to an ed that has gotten better over the years with me refusing time eat unless they do. 

I’m not sure if they are depressed as they have a tendency to hide their feeling and I’m not sure how I can support them or what I can do so if there is any insight on this please feel free to comment.

Thank you in advance.",depression,sadness,1

"I'm struggling with severe anxiety and depression, and I feel completely stuck I’ve been going through intense anxiety attacks almost every day for the past six months. They get so bad that I feel like I’m about to die. I cry a lot, and whenever my mom hears me, she yells at me instead of trying to understand. She always asks, ""Why are you crying again?"" like I’m not allowed to feel what I feel.

I keep telling her I need to see a therapist, but every time I bring it up, she gets nervous or angry. Once, she even insulted the therapist I had reached out to, calling her a liar.

M going thru a rare serious problem cz of mdma { sorry for my English)Before i took mdma for the first time.. i was thinking  i have a good heart .. and i was doing everything to prove that to my self... For example my music test is Justin Bieber - one direction.... I was doing good deeds like giving from my self to people even if i don't have it ... But i was expecting return from everything i do ... And that's caused me depression since long time ago... ( Realized that after i took mdma ) ... But .. i took mdma with my friend ..  and he saw a Devil in me .   Despite i was doing this.    I hate everything ... I hate people ..( here where my problem begin ) once while i was rolling on mdma ..my friend understood that i hate everything so he was talking about him doing weed and i hated that cz i didn't want to be addicted to anything anymore or maybe cz I'm jealous from him smoking weed? That's what he said ..  she shocked me ( he was talking in Normal way then when he reached to point where he talked about weed part .. he yelled saying don't let burn in your heart ..i was rolling so high on mdma and then suddenly  i woke up from it and since then I can't hide anything..  literally everything ... I can't control my face anymore .. this story happened 10 months ago ... M still going thru this until this day ) u may actually say why i didn't go to doctor ... I didn't know about it .i thought i was controlling my face.. And no one told me about it even my parents cz they wanted to see what inside my heart ... I know it's crazy and no sense story .. but it's true ... Everyone now knows that i hate them and i hate the place I'm living in ... Everyone knows about it before me  .... What should i do please.!!

Hi! I've been dealing with depression for a while now. My family know about my mental health, but I never told them the full extend of it. That was until I opened up to one of my siblings, hoping it would make me feel better. But the opposite happened. I felt extremely ashamed of my feelings, and ever since that day I told myself to hide them. Apparantely it works, because everyone seems to think I'm cured just because I smile more. However, atm I feel worse than I ever did before. Recently, I've gone back to self harm and been having suicidal thoughts basically all day every day. I'm a bit torn between opening up or keeping it to myself. I don't want people to worry, and I don't want them thinking I'm weird for it.
