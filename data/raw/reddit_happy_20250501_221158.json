    "text": "My husband and I made up The Brownie Rule\u2122\ufe0f early on in our marriage (over 10 years ago). It\u2019s been over 5 years since it\u2019s been used. The rule is, when there is an odd number of brownies, I get the extra. \n\nWe got an order of Domino\u2019s brownies with our dinner this week, and he did the divvying up of the brownies. He gave me my half and said, \u201cThere, we\u2019ve followed the brownie rule!\u201d\n\nI had totally forgotten, so he reminded me. He is always honest with me, and thinks the world of me. He makes me smile every day, is a great communicator, a fantastic parent, and so driven to take care of our family. \n\nHe has been by my side as my best friend since 2010, we\u2019ve been together since 2011, and got married in 2013. I was 19, and we were so sure of each other, and everyone saw that he treated me so well, that there weren\u2019t any actual objections to us getting married so young. When I wound up with schizoaffective disorder, I was just a shell of a person and was not the most pleasant person to be around. He was there by my side, encouraging me to keep going, taking care of our son and home, keeping up with my medical stuff, and doing whatever he could to keep us afloat when I was unable to work for a few years.  \n\nWe have our home, our son, and our wonderful family of blood relations and soul relations. We have a fun dog, a running vehicle, and a whole lot of love. He is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I just want to tell how much I love him to the world. ",

    "text": "This may seem like a small achievement to some, but to me, it means the world. \n\nI grew up pretty poor and never learned how to ride a bike, but I\u2019ve always wanted to. My dad was very good at it when he was younger, but unfortunately he had his bikes stolen before I was born. I always admired him for his skill, and wished I could be like him someday. \n\nWell, I\u2019m 22 now and one of my relatives who no longer rides decided I could have their bike. It needed cleaned and a new chain,  and I did that. I\u2019m overweight and my balance isn\u2019t great, so for the first two times I tried learning with the help of my roommate I got very frustrated and just could not get it.\n\nBut today, I tried yet again, and of course i couldn\u2019t get it no matter how hard I tried and I was getting so incredibly frustrated, I thought it must\u2019ve been because I wasn\u2019t talented and just could not get it.\n\nBut suddenly, right when I was about to quiet, a few young men in a nice grey sports car rolled up to the parking lot and rolled down the windows and shouted \u201cYOU\u2019RE DOING GREAT! YOU\u2019VE GOT THIS!\u201d And then drove off. And honestly, this helped so much, I think it was the last push I need - I immediately put my all into my next attempts and I DID IT! I fucking DID IT, guys! I\u2019ve been wanting to do it for so long and I finally managed to ride it! A few more tries with my roommate pushing me, then I managed to do it myself several times!\n\nThe neighbors of my apartment complex who were outside at that point even cheered me on and gave me tips, and it was so awesome to be able to do something I\u2019ve always wanted to do.\n\nI know this really is a small achievement, but I already feel myself wanting to get back on and do it again tomorrow. I have a feeling this will help me get out of my depressive episode and finally help me get some exercise. It\u2019s a huge achievement for me and I\u2019m so proud of myself for it.\n\nTo whoever those young men were in the grey car, thank you so much - you gave me the final push I really needed to finally be able to move forward.\n\nEvery time I ride now I think of my dad - thank you for everything and I just wish you were here to see me now.

Before that, we had gone to see his dad (his office is nearby) and I left everything with him (backpack with keys, his change of clothes, etc) before going to buy the stuff we needed. \n\nI got to the register and a lady behind me was looking kinda nervous with a sole bag of rice. I thought she was maybe going to ask me to go ahead of me, I had probably 10 or 15 things, not much, but still, I was going to let her go first, I was in no hurry. Then she asks \"Could you please save my spot? I just need eggs\" I assured her that would be no problem. My kid, being the goofy kind soul he is, started to march around her bag of rice that she left so that on one would take it either. She came back not a minute later, grateful and talking to my kid for a bit. \n\nOnce my things had been checked, I realized I had left my wallet in the backpack! I kinda panicked. I could use a QR code to pay, but I had not enough money in that account and my second account didnt' work with the QR code. I called my husband to ask him to pay, that I would send him the QR code, but the lady at the register was already giving me the stinkiest eye ever. \n\nAfter 3 minutes of waiting (I checked) and husband not being able to pay and also getting worried on the other end of the line, I told the exasperated woman behind the register to just cancel the whole transaction and I would be back within 10 minutes. It is then that the lady behind me said \"Hey, I can pay it for you and then you can transfer the money. That okay?\" I was like \"Yes! Thank you so much! Give me your number, I'll do it right now. Thank you again!\" She was all smiles and told me it was no problem. She paid my bill, paid hers and then I transferred the money to her account. \n\nIt was such a nice moment for me.

    "text": "I just wanted to come on here and document one of my most healing moments l've ever experienced-even if it happened over a year ago now, I still remember it like it was yesterday!\n\nFor context, I used to have trauma relating to physical touch from my first relationship (among other things, but that's not relevant for this story), where one of the results was in a fear of kissing.\n\nWith that being said, here's my story:\n\nAfter taking years to heal from my prior abusive relationship, I (22F) finally felt ready to enter back into the dating scene. After searching (for surprisingly not a long time), I matched with my Fiance (27M), and we started going out.\n\nI was very much a slow burn, and I warned him as much. Once we were a few dates in, he asked if he could kiss me for the first time. Of course, with me being a slow burn and having a reluctance towards kissing, I politely turned him down. But I also made sure to reassure him that I was definitely interested in him, just that I needed more time.\n\nNow, after a few more dates, I was really starting to fall for this guy. After a particularly lovely night where he took me to a concert and the night was filled with laughter and conversation, he asked once more if he could kiss me, right as I was leaving his car.\n\nI looked at him, and just felt so in awe of him. I thought, \"Man, I'm really starting to like this guy. I think he's earned it- he deserves at least one wholesome peck.\" More importantly, I wanted to give him a kiss.\n\nIn the abusive relationship that I was in, I always felt forced, manipulated, or bargained into giving physical affection- particularly with kisses. The first kiss I ever shared with my ex gave me the worst gut feeling I have ever felt in my life. I truly believe that feeling was from my guardian angel, and that I was being warned about the relationship I was entering.\n\nAnyways, back to this newfound healthy love!\n\nWe leaned in and shared the most wonderful kiss. I cannot stress this enough- it felt unreal. It couldn't have lasted for more than half a second, and yet time genuinely seemed to stop for me. I experienced the most intense feel-good butterflies l've ever felt. It seemed just like the movies and stories l've read; sparks seemed to fly around us in that moment.\n\nIt was such a beautiful, healing moment for me. To go from such horrible, gut-wrenching fear and trauma, to feeling over the moon in happiness is something I'll never forget.",

    "text": "The best way to keep happy calves is by providing them with hoppy entertainment, a young farmer says. Irish man and farmer Philip Stewart, 28, has come up with some creative ideas to keep his farm animals in high spirits.\n\nHis calves love to play with massive red space hoppers- which are usually used by children to bounce up and down on. The third generation farmer says toys that keep his animals occupied are paramount to their happiness.\n\nHe also fills small holed balls with hay so that the young cows have fun while feeding. The farmer, who has a Youtube channel documenting the antics of his family\u2019s 400-acre farm, said: \u201cHappy calves need enrichment, and the Temu space hopper - usually a children\u2019s toy - is keeping the bulls entertained in the barn day and night.\u201d\n\nAfter completing his farming qualifications in 2016, Philip runs a farm with around 250 dairy beef calves. He wanted to put his own stamp on the family business - and one of his ideas was looking at different ways to acquire bulk products needed for its everyday running.\n\nThe farmer buys many supplies from online shopping platform Temu - including the space hoppers and hay balls. He also purchased products from the site that he found hard to access in the Irish midlands, such as a vaccine gun, 20 syringes and several bottles.\n\nPhilip said: \u201cWe use a large bag of syringes and bottles every week for multi-mineral shots and vaccines. But the local co-op usually sells vaccine consumables in batches of five or ten.\n\n\"We just need consumable quantities that work for our commercial scale \u2013 Temu had them and we got them fast. And when our dosing gun broke, we had spares ready to go. It was a lifesaver.\n\n\u201cOur friends and fellow farmers were sceptical at first, and now our friends are asking where we got everything.\u201d",

    "text": "I wouldn't say I felt unhappy, but for a long time I felt a lack of motivation and a lack of meaning in life, like I was an incomplete person who did well enough but knew there was room for improvement. I decided recently to do something about it and just wanted to see if there was anyone who had similar feelings about life who could be with me on my journey, like a close accountability partner, I tend to do better when I have someone like that I can confide in. I made a simple post just talking about the kind of person I am like my faults, and what I desire in someone. I was expecting harsh criticism, sly remarks, and I did certainly get it from people, since the idea of anyone wanting a feeling of love in their life seems to tick people off and make them say the worst online, but to my absolute surprise someone came to me and offered. I mean it has not been that long at all but just the gesture made me feel special, and she has already been so much more comfortable for me to talk to than a lot of other people, I genuinely feel like I can relax around her and we can just enjoy talking and getting to know eachother, it is a truly amazing feeling. I want to be a better person just because she is in my life now, and just the thought of her throughout my day makes me make better choices, I just am really satisfied with life right now. Just meeting the right person flipped a switch in me to want to change. I am truly grateful to her and while I feel like I don't know the right things to say (most of the time) or I am awkward, I feel like she doesn't have a problem with that and understands. I fear I scare people away because of how attached I can feel, but I feel like it is mutual this time around. I don't know a lot about her yet but I think that feeling of walking into the unknown is exciting, putting my trust into someone and not doubting at all, and I want to get to know more about her day by day like uncovering a mystery. I think this may be the most i've ever been effected by a person in such a short amount of time, it's exhilarating for me. Words fail to express the happiness I feel right now, how content I am with the way things are. Anyways.. Just needed that off my chest, I obviously cannot send a 40 page document to her describing every facit of emotion I am feeling, but I figured others may benefit from this and it may be a motivation to them to brighten their day \\^-\\^",
