    "title": "Our most-broken and least-understood rules is \"helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort\", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",
    "text": "We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \n\nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \n\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\n*****\n\n###Summary###\n\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** \n\n\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \n\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \n\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \n\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \n\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\n\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

    "text": "Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you're having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, or have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these aren't allowed standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule),  this is a place you can share.\n\n-----\n\nOur subreddit rules are very different from most of the rest of reddit!  Since all of them exist for important reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\n\nWe also have several resource wikis for help with finding and giving support:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\n\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see here are:\n\n- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\n- \"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\n\n- Role modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\n\n- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support  (rules 1, 2 and 10).\n\n- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal issues. Grief, sadness, anger, loneliness and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

When I was diagnosed it kinda made sense, it felt like all of a sudden I was \u201callowed\u201d to feel the way I feel whereas before I was just someone who was failing in life (I was 22 at the time) probably depressed, CPTSD and undiagnosed autistic (which I didn\u2019t know at the time). So if anyone ever feels like that I just wanted to say I get you. And coming from a not so warm family I needed the cancer as an \u201cexcuse\u201d to care about my mental health. And the craziest thing is the psychological issues I dealt with before, during and after cancer were SO much worse than the cancer itself for me. When I had cancer I felt like I finally had a diagnosis that \u201clived up\u201d to how I actually felt inside. ",

    "text": "About 4 months ago in January/ late December I had made a post on reddit also asking for advice about a breakup I was going through. trying not to restate the whole post, long story really short, basically I was broken up with, and I don't know why, I can speculate all day, but it's just not helping me, by doing that. the post attracted one person to comment some supporting words which I did not forget about, appreciate and did take to heart, saying that I need to keep going and keep eating, stay healthy etc. \n\nSo, update since then, the good parts, I started taking medicine to help with anxiety and depression, with that I picked up a new hobby or if I'm honest, something to distract me, motorcycling riding. that's about all for the good, on the other hand, I lost my job, I'm in debt from taking out loans which I could pay if I kept my job, I'm stressed out with my family members medical issues, and to keep it brief, I feel stressed, every day I wake up\n\nRelationship wise, I'm stuck I feel as if it's Wrong to move on as I put everything, I had into her, and to let go of the memories we had, but I know I couldn't and wouldn't take her back if she texted me today, because of the pain it put me through. By now, I thought with my combined efforts of deleting all social media reddit included, not looking back at past pictures and thinking about the times we spent together, my attempts to medicate, lack of communication to her, and self-allowance, knowing I'm going to have bad days, then better ones, that I would eventually grow past this person, and hardships I'm going through. But, I haven't, I don't know if this is normal or not, to not be over someone in about 4 months or so that you knew for years, regardless how this all ties together is, I was unable to focus at work, not motivated enough to go out and talk to more people, and my mood was constantly down. consequently, I was fired, and I just sat there, freaking out inside, unbothered on the outside.\n\nProfessional wise, I'm too stuck in my own head that can't compartmentalize work from personal, and i end up spacing out, and it causes me to make mistakes, and sometimes not even remember them. leaving the only thing I can say is \"I don't remember what happened\" like I'm on auto pilot 99% of the time. I need a new job now of course, and I been searching ever since, but I don't even know if it will turn up like the last one I had, as it seems to be a bigger issue than I originally let on.\n\nFamily and personal wise, I put these 2 together because some of this is me overthinking, some is true with losing my job I had to move back in with my parents, which I didn't want to do as I hate feeling that I leech off them. I offered to pay rent with the money I have saved, my mom declined taking it. my stepdad made some comments about how old I am coming back to live with them is ridiculous and that I should figure it out on my own. which only makes feel that I'm letting them down.  The meds I been on haven't been working as well as when I was first given them, then again to someone who's so used to feeling abnormal, normal is the weird feeling, if that makes any sense...\n\nAnyway, I don't want to feel as if I failed, relationship wise, professional wise, family wise, and personal wise.

I cannot sleep when I feel like because every night is filled with insecurity, trust issues, guilt for existing and more and more ideas to kill myself. Thoughts control when I get to sleep. \n\n2. When I wake up is also controlled by depression. Since I have such a bad headache by afternoon every day I need to wake up early to start studying early. And my sleep isn't great because hey someone is in the darkness watching you and ghosts and nightmares idk what else. Migraine and dizziness sucks. \n\n3. How much I eat also is dependent on this because I have so much pain in my throat every time I try swallowing something. It is GERD and the only reason at my age to have it is because of some mental illness. \n\n4. How I talk to people is controlled by it because I just feel guilty for them having to be near someone like me, having to talk to someone as disgusting as me, someone as lazy and selfish as me. I want to escape from everyone. Run away kill myself not have to face anyone. Otherwise I'll have to be as silent as I can while literally screaming from inside and appear as if I'm the happiest person on this planet. \n\n5. How much I can concentrate, how I can communicate is controlled by it. I have to talk to patients in the hospital, if I live long enough I'll be a doctor in the next 1 year. I cannot study properly forget about retaining material. Concentration, the will, the desire, the interest, everything is gone. I cannot communicate with patients well because my mind works literally so slowly that I can barely follow what they say. Normal speed is too fast for me with all the dissociation. \n\nDo I want to get better? Honestly no because even if there is a slightest possibility of me getting better, I am not a good person, I'm gonna relapse very quickly and I'd never wanna be where I am now.\n\nPeople say: \"The only way out is through\".

I thought I was getting better, but now I\u2019m back at square one. My parents say if I keep doing this I\u2019ll be taken away and go to court for the amount of days I missed. I have so many Saturday schools, and I\u2019ll probably be held back. I\u2019m scared of this but even though I know this could happen, I can\u2019t bring myself to change.

Great jobs, Great friendships.  Everything has been going well. But this year, my good friend and roommate moved out, I'm unemployed now, and I've lost pretty much all interest, in any and everything. \n\nI was the last person you'd think would turn into a crazy loner, but people just don't interest me anymore, nor do I think I have much to share or contribute to anyone else. I just find myself utterly exhausted by everything. I was really hard working and driven, I had a hobby that I got paid for, I've traveled the world, been with a ton of women, and I've worked at some of the most prestigious institutions in the world....but now all of that is gone, and I feel completely burnt out.   \n  \nNow, I actively try not to speak with people and In a weird way, I'm almost content with how empty my life is. I didn't think I'd feel this way so soon.  I can still go outside, exercise, enjoy a beautiful day....  \n  \nBut I've fallen out of love with life and I'm not taking any steps to improve myself and that's frustrating to admit. I know I'm probably just wallowing in self pity, hence why I think I have nothing to share. Even when I'm invited out to things, I usually choose not to go.   \n  \nMost the time I feel like I'm just better off rotting away alone. \n\n",

I put in so much work to continually better myself, love myself, accept myself. I exhaust so much effort into making others around me happy. I always show up yet never shown up for. I always listen but can never be heard. I\u2019m constantly falling short in every aspect in life. I\u2019m a shell of the human i once was. Nothing brings me joy, pleasure, happiness. Only sadness and anger. I remember what it was like to be happy. Barely. But the distant feeling of wonder, and excitement is so far out of reach that it only exhausts me more trying to catch it. I\u2019ve spent so many years breaking down my walls, making myself more vulnerable, trying to be a better man. To feel normal in a crowd. To feel loved by their peers. I thought i was there. But the reality was that I\u2019ll never be there. There will always be something holding me back. Someone to take away the hope. The things i hope for never come true, and i think the reason ive suffered for this long is because all i can remember is how often ive hoped for this life to end. Maybe its because the things i hope for will never come along. Maybe my life hasn\u2019t ended because then I\u2019ll be in a better place and for some strange reason the universe wants me to keep crawling through this darkness. Death is the one thing i hope for anymore. But maybe hope isn\u2019t enough to put me at peace. This isn\u2019t a cry for help. My mind has been made up.

    "text": "TLTR;\n I've been living in the States for about 5 years now. I moved here for my fiance since his family is here. At first I loved it! A different scenery, a chance to start over and be new. But now I just miss everything about home. Slowly the past 2 years I've been missing home, more and more.\n\n Now I just feel an anger inside, I feel like I missed so much. My cat died, that really got me, I loved that cat, my parents were taking good care of him. Then a very close friend of mine passed, and I wasn't there and couldn't even make it to the funeral. My parents are getting older, a part of me is always worried to get a call that something happened to one of them. My friends back home all went through something and I feel like I can't support them as well as I'd like too. \n\n I'm just here. I've been the only one working for 5 months, rent is expensive! Then the bills.. and food.. I don't even like thinking about what to have for dinner anymore, I dread that question. Everything just stresses me out so badly, I don't know how to deal with my emotions anymore. I have been going to the gym, that seems to be the only thing keeping me somewhat sane. \n\n I just also can't stand the people now, all these small things get to me and I know they shouldn't, but they do. Just driving to work this morning my spotify wouldnt connctect. Or it just kept disconnecting, anyways it was was a point I just started balling my eyes out. I just want music. Everything feels against me, I feel like I'm drowning, and breathing exersizes dont seem to help, I just want to cry more. I just want to rip my hair out and scream. I don't know how to deal with this, any hobby I have I've lost interest. I love video games, but of course, my friends only all either don't like each other or lately super passive aggresive, makes me hate playing games with anyone..\n\nMy fiance is amazing, and I love him! Don't get me wrong, he does make me so happy and fortunate to be with someone like him. He's gone through a lot as well, at first when he quite his job I was and still 100% with him and will support him, but it's been 5 months.. I'm struggling to keep up with everything. He knows it too, he's been looking for work but because of previous jobs he had a back injury, he's having a hard time find work. He had quite a few interviews but no call backs. He's stressed and depressed, I'm stressed and depressed. \n\n I'm trying my best to keep it together, I miss my family, I miss the support, I miss my old community. This place sucks. The people suck, I used to love the food now I'm bored and hate it. I've gained so much weight, I hate how I feel and look. It's the biggest I've ever been in my life, it's so embarrassing and humiliating. Everything feels against me, everything is so overwhelming I don't know what to do or think anymore, I'm scared. I'm worried all the time. I hate this, this feeling is horrible, I'm just lost. So damn lost. \n\n\nSorry that this is long, and probably all over the place, I just needed to write it down, say something because there's nothing else I feel like I can do. I love and hate my life right now. I'm an mess.  I hope others don't ever feel this way, it's a horrible feeling. Has anyone else gotten through this feeling? Just anything, any words. Any person. ",

    "text": "Hello community.\n\nI need some advice from you, because I, or rather my brother, am facing a big problem.\n\nMy brother (29) has had severe depression for about 3 years now (I think it runs in our family) and he can't get out of it despite regular therapy. He repeatedly has the feeling of not being worth anything and not being able to do anything, which leads to extreme fears about the future, feelings of powerlessness and no proper sleep (he says he sleeps a maximum of 4 hours a night, although he goes to bed around 22:00, but can't fall asleep).\n\nFor context: He works in our family business in the construction industry (which I also worked in but managed to leave). The industry is very tough and the family situation, especially with our father, who is otherwise loving and does everything for us, is very difficult to work with and always shakes his self-esteem anew. After a 2-year sabbatical and therapy, things went well again for a while, but a few days ago everything escalated again and he couldn't help but start crying. The mental stress he is under causes him to make mistakes and lack energy, which of course fuels the vicious circle.\n\nIn my opinion, the job in our family business doesn't play to his skills and he needs to do something else to prove his abilities and rebuild his self-confidence.\n\nHe somehow knows this too, but he can't find the strength to change anything (I know the feeling of permanently overwhelming tiredness).\n\nI would like to get him to support him on his way out of the company and get him into an activity (possibly volunteering with the Red Cross) so that he sees that he is not worthless or without ability and to get to know other people and ways of life\n\nWhat tips/procedures/strategies would you have for me so that I can get him on this path and support him? (because he needs help here, he can't do it alone) \nIf anyone has experienced this, what has helped you and what have you done?\n\nThank you in advance\n\n",

    "text": "Hi all.\nI know it's a long post, sorry about that.\nIf you have any questions I'll probably be happy to answer them below.\n\nI'm 22, living at home.\nMy life is an unending series of disasters.\n\nPeople have always said I'm a hot head and I have problems with authority. That's just not the case. Recently 2 or 3 people have even used the word aggressive to describe me or how I come accross. I think that is because my breaking down has really started approaching critical levels in the last 1-3 years.\n(I'm not some aggressive beast who yells at people, I promise.)\n\nI have a problem with people who abuse me or others via their authority (it's pretty common if you open your eyes).\nI didn't get on well in primary school was always messing and in trouble and talking back to teachers etc. \nI'm smart and was raised well, largely avoiding physical fights, never bullied others, treating women well and so on and so forth.\nSecondary school was no better. I moved with my mum from my home town to the capital and left my dad behind. \nIn school I managed to conduct the first year fairly normally but by second year cracks were showing. By third year I had started skipping school, smoking, drinking and lots of dating. Covid hit in 5th year at which point I dropped out (not having a crystal ball to tell me about predicted grades, would have probably stayed if I knew I could get a reasonable grade with minimal work).\n\nStarted working full time around then and since then have been in and out of jobs up to now. 6 months working here, 2 months wasting time and nulling emotions there, and so on. \nI did survive 6-12 months in a few places but most of my employment has ended within 3-4 months for one reason or another. During 2020 to say 2022 ish, it felt easy to go from one place to another. I barely had to apply to a handful of places before I'd have another job offer. It's changed since then, and I've had a terribly hard time finding work. And the work I have found has been consistently lower quality (albeit always the same minimum wage pay). Think going from a grocery store -> nice office environment -> back to poxy retail.\n\nI'm not qualified for anything in any way other than retail really. I am hoping to start a course in the next few months which if I am successful will enable me to go and work in the field I want to work in. (After 18 months of getting through the course on a minimum wage job (if I can even find a new job))\n\nI recently lost my job while still in probation period.\nIt was brutal. It was unfair. Unwarranted. And it came from a manager who did everything to pretend they were my friend. (Trust me, I've now begun internalising the idea that nobody at work is my friend.) And it came just days after a devastating medical diagnoses for one of my parents, which I had shared just days before with that same manager who had told me how hard it was for them when their parent had a similar very serious health problem. (I wonder how much harder it would've been for them if they got f***ed out of their job during such a time...)\n\nI've never seriously studied anything, other than light research in personal time into all the various things I thought I was interested in before realising they were way too ambitious and/or unrealistic.\n\nI'm really struggling right now. I have no savings. I have no job. I have no qualifications. I have no career. I have no friends (except some who are far far away living their own happy lives). I've never achieved anything in my life. \nOne parent is gravely sick and I am taking public transport the length of the country every other day to act as a caretaker for them. My friends have gone to different countries to pursue their careers and more.\nI just feel like a massive fuckup every second of every day because I am and I want change but the realities of this world make me think it isn't worth living through. If I did decide to take my life I would probably go on a 'holiday' and go missing or something.\n\nI'm lonely. I'm tired. I have nothing to show for any/all of the effort I've ever given anything. I'm struggling to use logic to form reasons I shouldn't give up. \n\nI haven't dated in 2.5 years and my confidence in all aspects not just romantically has never been lower.\n\nI don't know if I can start fresh or rebuild from these foundations or lack thereof.\n\nI have no more money for food, travel, haircuts etc so I am living off my family. It feels shitty. I should have my own money. I should have a car and a life like my friends do. But I don't. Because I may not be a hot head but I sure do come across that way when I am faced with utter bullshit.\n\nDon't know how to end this post but thank you for taking the time to read or reply.\n\nI know things could be obviously worse but at the same time, I hope it's not selfish to say that that doesn't help me, and my life certainly isn't a walk in the park.",

    "text": "Notes: I speak Spanish, so I use a translator. Sorry for any spelling errors. This is an account I don't use, so I hope I'm not putting myself at risk. \n\nI (19 M) need help. This can be summed up as: I looked for trouble, created a problem, and now I'm panicking about the consequences of the problem I created. \n\nI am someone who believes in magic, logically I am not mentally well (lol), and a few days ago I was curious to know what it would be like to be bewitched or \"amarrado\" (latinamerican) So I googled a witch. I remember her page well because it had a gothic font and it caught my attention. I contacted her and paid her some money. Basically, I didn't have to do anything until we had a video call, you see, I was expecting weird candles and a weird spell, but in the video call he showed a \"voodoo\" doll of me and the person (I'll explain what happened later), I panicked when I saw that and his altar since it looked a little creepy and I just stopped thinking. When he mentioned that he would send me a package (she had my brother's address, because I gave it to him while I was shocked) with a medallion, the box with the voodoo and animals for me to kill them and bury them in a cemetery. She then mentioned that she could do it for a price, and I didn't really listen after that. I order her to cancel everything, and she told me it would have to be around $770 USD for that or they would tell the boy what he tried to do to him,  I hung up, blocked her, and deleted the chat (though it may not have been deleted entirely, I'm not good at this things). \n\n\nI confessed to my brother everything that happened, he was obviously upset and I'm scared that he's messed up everything, our years-long bestie relationship, the possibility of moving out, and his safety, I also had to confess it to his partner, because I had screwed them both. \n\nAfter a couple of hours, the \"leader\" showed me a video of the video call without my consent. In this video, I appear saying part of the \"spell\" I mentioned:  If I don't do this, I will give you the most beloved thing (to you, Saint Death). It was meant to embarrass me even more, but it was a stupid move, since in that video call his \"disciple\" revealed the killing of animals and even suggested stealing to get the money. She (the leader) also tried to roast me in a group of witches, saying, \"Does anyone know this guy? He opened a dangerous portal and now he could die, also I'm looking for the other one.\" She showed it to me saying that I should pay her $500 USD to not say anything to the boy and to \"close the portal.\" \n\nThe boy the spell was directed at wasn't even interesting to me, I only put him in because he was the only boy whose full name I remembered. But even that makes me see what a terrible person I was being. \n\nThis was two days ago (as I write this it's the third) and since then I haven't stopped feeling anxious, everything feels so unreal, and I've had suicidal thoughts again, which I haven't had since months ago. At this point, I don't want to kill myself or continue thinking about it, but I don't know what to do. He knows my full name, the man's name, my address, and my brother's and my phone numbers. \n\nI've been researching various forums to see what's done in these cases, but none of them screwed up as much as I did, or even worse than I did. So I decided to post my own case. ",

    "text": "I genuinely think that one of the biggest misconceptions we grow up with is the belief that life is fair. And as I grow older, as I become an adult, I realise that it\u2019s not true.\n\nThe thing is, that some people are lucky. Some get the chance to realise their deepest dream, meeting their forever person, professional success, getting rich, whatever success looks like for them. But unfortunately, others out there have a string of bad luck after bad luck. Getting sick, losing the only person you care about, losing your job\u2026 the list goes on.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that success depends only on luck, no. Sometimes, you really do have to put in the work. But again, unfortunately, you can work as hard and as smart as possible and still fail. You could be a good-hearted person, do everything right and still end up with a miserable life. While, out there, this bad person, seems to be living the perfect life.\n\nLife isn\u2019t fair. And guess what ? I think it is okay. Maybe you should adjust your hopes and dreams based on what you have. You can't change the direction of the wind, but you can adjust your sails. Go with the flow and adapt to the situation in front of you. Because I truly think some people spend more time complaining than taking action.\n\nI just wanted to share this. Maybe it will help someone, like it helped me.  \nIt\u2019s okay to fail where others succeeded. It\u2019s okay to let go of that childhood dream. Live your life the way you want, because it\u2019s yours \u2014 as long as you're not hurting anyone or doing something illegal, of course. And especially for those in this subreddit: you already have your mental illness to deal with, so don\u2019t add more weight to an already heavy load. *(And keep taking your meds, lol.)*",

Having to stay protected from the devil. Having to isolate myself from ppl that are suppose to be family and care about me. Having to question intentions. I believe in God and don't want to disrespect him by acting like my life is disposable but I'm so tired. ",

My partner has suffered with depression in that past and has made an attempt to before (around 14). Their room is never clean and as much as I dont mind much however it concerns me, they don\u2019t shower often however do skincare every other night. They don\u2019t ever wanna seem to go out and try avoiding getting out of the house as much as possible. They hate getting out of bed to do anything and either forget to eat or eat a meal a day. \nThey do cook when I come around around twice per day for us to eat and make snacks through out the day for us as I have picked up on the low eating a while back due to an ed that has gotten better over the years with me refusing time eat unless they do. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if they are depressed as they have a tendency to hide their feeling and I\u2019m not sure how I can support them or what I can do so if there is any insight on this please feel free to comment.\n\nThank you in advance.

My family know about my mental health, but I never told them the full extend of it. That was until I opened up to one of my siblings, hoping it would make me feel better. But the opposite happened. I felt extremely ashamed of my feelings, and ever since that day I told myself to hide them. Apparantely it works, because everyone seems to think I'm cured just because I smile more. However, atm I feel worse than I ever did before. Recently, I've gone back to self harm and been having suicidal thoughts basically all day every day. I'm a bit torn between opening up or keeping it to myself. I don't want people to worry, and I don't want them thinking I'm weird for it. But at the same time it's getting really really bad now, to a point where I've had times where I didn't feel safe with myself. \nCould you please give me some advice on what I should do? If you think I should open up, please tell my why you think that. Thanks a lot!",
