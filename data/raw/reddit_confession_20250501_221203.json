    "title": "I just spent $60 for the most disappointing BJ ever",
    "text": "I\u2019ve never thought of prostitutes before. But I\u2019ve been so incredibly busy with life and work for the last two years or more, I haven\u2019t dated anybody in that time or even gone out with anyone.\n\nI\u2019m not exactly flattering and I don\u2019t quite have the time to go to night life to try my luck there.\n\nI was just SO horny. So impulsively I pulled up to the area in my city known for having prostitutes going up and down the street looking for business. My goal was to pay for some cheap hole to stick into that was at least an actual vagina, bust, and leave.\n\nI felt so awkward and didn\u2019t even have the balls to tell her I wanted to fk her hole and leave and be done, I just went with \u201cI don\u2019t know yet\u201d, got her into my car and went with the flow.\n\nUuuhh \u201cthe flow\u201d ended up in me paying $20 for her to get some shit at a gas station, then pull up to some random apartment complex where we had to be so sneaky I couldn\u2019t even TRY to enjoy it, and denied pussy for that very reason when I asked.\n\nI settled for a BJ that I couldn\u2019t even get hard for. And she charged me $40 for it.\n\nUltimately it\u2019s okay, an overwhelmingly disappointing blowjob at a sketchy area of town with all the risk involved with no repercussions was well worth the $60 looking back. Could\u2019ve been a lot worse, got the wrong person in my car, busted by cops, who knows.\n\nThanks for reading if you did, I just needed to get it out somewhere and there\u2019s zero chance I\u2019m telling this to a single soul ever.\n\n**REFLECTION UPDATE**\n\nAlright I thought about this for a while since I posted this and finally came up with how I wanted to word the answer I was looking for to all the people saying I dehumanized this woman by calling her a cheap hole.\n\nI\u2018ll admit I am an asshole when it comes to wording, I don\u2019t sugar coat bullshit and I called her a cheap hole cause that\u2019s what she is. What do you rather I had called her? A bargain promiscuous lady? Lmfao. Like alright I can call her a cheap sex worker, but why bullshit? She a street hoe. I\u2019m an asshole. That doesn\u2019t mean I think less of her. I can simultaneously call people out for what they are while also respecting their choices - believe it or not in such a CRAZY concept. I treated her very nicely from start to end precisely cause I was respectful that she\u2019s providing me a service. I stopped her mid sucking my limp dick cause I felt BAD for her for dealing with a soft guy for the last 10min and wanted to let her go her way. I would not be surprised if I was actually the person who treated her the nicest the entire night. And I didn\u2019t treat her nicely as means to an end, I treated her nicely cause every human deserves to be treated well. Regardless of profession, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc. unless they specifically done something to you that warrants it.\n\nBut if you a bum I\u2019ll call you a bum, if you\u2019re a bitch I\u2019ll call you a bitch, if you\u2019re an asshole you\u2019re an asshole, if you\u2019re a hoe you\u2019re a hoe. Why are some words okay and others not? You all called me asshole, shouldn\u2019t you have respected me and called me an unpleasant guy? LOL no you called me for what I was.\n\nI did not call her a cheap hole to dehumanize her or with the intention to disrespect her, however, that\u2019s what Y\u2019ALL assumed from the wording. You\u2019re free to not believe me, and think because I used the word cheap hole there\u2019s somehow no way I still believe she deserves to be treated well. I respect hoes, they\u2019re just doing their thing, making their money. I treat them with respect and I\u2019m always polite, but if you\u2019re a hoe you\u2019re a hoe and that\u2019s okay.\n\nI can both call you a hoe and still respect you as a human being, I\u2019m just choosing not to use some more socially acceptable word in order to be presentable. On that end I am an asshole and I\u2019ll admit to it. If you\u2019re a hoe be a hoe, don\u2019t be offended someone calls you a hoe - that\u2019s what you are?? With that said I\u2019m not gonna treat you as less of a person.\n\nMy sister is a stripper, she had only fans before and many partners. I\u2019d tell her and people who\u2019d ask to go out with her that she\u2019s a hoe, why? Cause she was a hoe like tf? She never took offense to it cause it was the truth. I ain\u2019t gonna call her prude cause she\u2019s not. I simultaneously did not judge her choices one bit and would not let someone think less or disrespect my sister because she is a stripper and had an only fans. If calling someone an at best controversial word despite being what they actually are is highly offensive to you idc get off your snowflake island. I still respect them regardless, I just don\u2019t act like a pussy and use more \u201cacceptable terms\u201d to convey it.\n\nI think it\u2019s real silly for any sex worker to get offended by being told how things are: she was a $40 BJ from the middle of the street. She was a street hoe. That doesn\u2019t mean I treated her less than she deserved or called her that in my story to dehumanize her, it\u2019s just how y\u2019all perceived it. And deduced my entire personality as someone who doesn\u2019t respect others. If your standards start with what word I choose to call someone, yeah you lost me there - definitely the asshole in that case. I won\u2019t treat you anything but well though.\n\nCheck all my fkn replies. Did I call anyone any names? Curse anybody out? Acted disrespectful towards anyone? Tried to fight anyone wishing me terrible things? I did not. Matter fact I believe I held myself very reasonably this entire time. If I was a disgusting pig who doesn\u2019t respect others, or women for that matter, how come I\u2019m so polite to everyone who\u2019s been judging me? Beats me bro.",

    "title": "I lied about the pain during my colonoscopy to get more fentanyl",
    "text": "During my pre-colonoscopy appointment I was told that the local anaesthesia I would be given fentanyl. And so knowing that this would probably be the only time to experience it I was honestly excited. To preface this was about a year ago and I hadn\u2019t tried any other drug apart from weed and mushrooms at that point.\n\nTo preface I\u2019ve always been curious about the feelings of different highs from different drugs. With all the negativity surrounding fentanyl I knew this would be the best time to experience it.\n\nFast forward to the beginning of my colonoscopy, I was to let them know if I was experiencing pain and a lot of discomfort. \n\nI get injected with my starting dose and they start the operation and whilst I still feel the effects of it - it wasn\u2019t really a euphoric or energetic high, but a drowsy and blissful sort of one. So I\u2019m laying there on the \u2018hospital bed\u2019 (idk) just watching the camera go through my insides and I just can\u2019t help but wonder if I could get some more because I wasn\u2019t really feeling any euphoria. \n\nI then begin to make fake grunting sounds as if I\u2019m in pain and one of the nurses holds my hand and tells me to squeeze if I\u2019m in pain. I squeeze and they then give me some more. As they\u2019re injecting me with it they tell me that this is the most they\u2019re giving me (which was a lie for some reason, I\u2019ll go into that later). I start feeling like I\u2019m being absorbed into the bed. \n\nSome time goes by (no clue how much) and the same thought pops up again - \u201cI wonder what more feels like. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m gonna die of an overdose surrounded by all of these doctors right?\n\nMore grunting and moaning sounds later I\u2019m being injected with more despite being told that the previous dose was the last one (I may be misremembering and that this was when I was told it was the last dose but I\u2019m almost certain they told me that twice including this time).\n\nI\u2019m feeling super light now and feel like I could just look at the wall forever laying there on that bed. That\u2019s all I really remember up to that point. I barely remember the end of the colonoscopy and don\u2019t remember being wheeled into another room after it ended. \n\nI do however remember, after being wheeled into another room, listening to some type of calming instrumental music on my phone. A doctor walked in to check my vitals and he asked what I was listening to and I said rock music for some reason (I don\u2019t even listen to rock or anything like it). He then asked who my favourite rock band was or something like that and I replied Michael Jackson not even in a joking manner or anything idk wtf possessed me to even say rock or Michael Jackson. He then just left the room I don\u2019t really remember his reaction, he didn\u2019t really have any to my recollection. \n\nBut that was about it, I was in that room for a couple more hours until I was picked up by my mom to be taken home or I would\u2019ve had to have been there for 24 hours. \n\n",

    "text": "Throwaway because my wife views my main account. \n\nI went to the Philippines for a work trip and when checking into the hotel the front desk asked if I wanted a massage charged to the room. She said it would be $18USD for 1 hour. That was a no brainer for me so I told her let\u2019s do it. Called to talk to my wife and told her about it and she joked \u201cdon\u2019t be getting no happy endings\u201d, which I laughed because I honestly had never thought of that. \n\nThe massage person ended up coming to my room and I took off my clothes and laid on the bed and she covered my butt with a small towel. She began the massage and I slowly was drifting into a purely relaxed mode. It must have been about 20-30 min but I heard her tell me to turn over, which I did. She covered my penis area with the towel and proceeded to massage my feet and legs. I\u2019m not sure what got me but when she would rub my leg, the top of her hand would slightly brush against my penis. It was nothing for a bit but all of the sudden I began to become harder and harder to which she noticed and chuckled. She moved down towards my ankle and calf but I  could not get my erection to calm down. The towel then fell off my penis because of the erection and I didn\u2019t know what to do, and all of the sudden I felt this massive buildup in me and realized I was about to cum. I froze with fear and she kept rubbing my calf\u2019s and then all of the sudden I just exploded, right there in front of her. She looked very surprised and I was super embarrassed. She cleaned me up and the massage came to an end about 10 min later. I apologized to her and gave her a decent tip and was hoping I would never see her again. \n\nI talked to my wife that next day and she asked how it went and I told her it went great and nothing else. I felt so incredibly bad that I had lied to her and not told her about it. I\u2019m not sure if I was in the wrong but it sure felt like it so I kept quiet. This has been eating me up for years and I just want to find a way to tell her. ",

    "text": "I went into the 2020 pandemic during the biggest breakup of my life. (At that point). \n\nSoon enough, Nicole came along. \n\nShe requested to follow me late one night on IG, so I shot my shot. \n\nBefore I knew it, we were on the phone, talking, exchanging secrets, etc. \n\nTikTok was pretty big back then considering people were trapped in their houses.\n\nI saw a video that day claiming that women fantasize about sex 43 times a day on average. \n\nI decide to bring it up. Before you know it, I spun a lie to make her horny enough to start rubbing with me on the phone. \n\n(I have a sexy voice and active imagination). \n\nWe were pretty serious for a day and a half or so, then I realized it couldn\u2019t really go anywhere cause we came from very different backgrounds. \n\nEventually, she became a very good friend. \n\nShe\u2019d send me money regularly, buy me food, and most importantly was there for me when I needed. (I returned the favor). \n\nEventually when I was aware of her sexuality, I\u2019d literally FaceTime her, pull my dick out, she\u2019d sarcastically roll her eyes, put on a show for me, let me finish, and we\u2019d hang up. \n\nShe even sent me birthday money once.\n\nEventually she got really involved with her boyfriend, so she disappeared for a few months. \n\nSomeone close to her let me know that after it ended, she\u2019d been looking to talk to me. \n\nI find out that one night while we were having phone sex, her boyfriend was sleeping on another phone in the background. (Very funny, but suckish for the guy). \n\nThen she eventually found someone new who I encouraged her to go after. Pretty sure they\u2019re married. \n\nI miss her doe. \n\n(Just wanted to post). ",

    "text": "In 7th grade, I was that guy who had 2 close friends(we were a trio). I used to talk to my classmates sometimes about random stuff but never made any friends. Me and my friends always used to sit together, we used to talk and laugh during lectures, but we never caused trouble for others. One day, the teacher separated the entire trio. I was made to sit next to a girl. She was nice to me. I let her copy notes sometimes. She helped me out too. I think we became friends then, we used to talk about movies, music, etc. Then other students started teasing me and her. They used to call us lovers and all. At first, I didn't bother. But then, things started getting out of hand. They wouldn't stop. They used to call me by her name when I passed by. I was really bothered by it. I tried to stop them. Even my friends stepped in to help, but it was of no use. One guy even wrote our name in heart on a bench with a marker. Then I completely stopped talking to her. I didn't want to be teased by others. She noticed the change and came and tried to talk about it. I just told her to leave me alone. She didn't have any friends. She was all alone. She had lost her mother, just 2 months before this happened. One could see that she was disturbed by that. She didn't express it much, but one could tell she was hurt because of how I pushed her away like that. Soon, she changed the school. My friends later told me, what I did was wrong. I regretted it. I am now a First Year college student. I recently saw her while I was on my way to college. I do not know if she saw me, or if she even remembers me. But, I very well remember her and am ashamed of my previous actions. I wanted to go up to her and talk to her and wanted to apologize but I couldn't. I just stood there watching her leave.",

    "text": "Sorry. This is a bit of a nasty confession I can't admit to anyone in real life. I have a habit of chewing on things because I like the texture. I've chewed on the soft parts of my fingers, beauty blender sponges and straws because it just feels so good to keep chewing.\n\nOne time, I was grooming myself and cutting my toenails. I noticed that I had a lot of dead skin on the sole of my foot, and decided to try cutting it off with a penknife since I'd done similar things to my calluses before. So I did, and I cut a really big thick round piece out (think 3mm thickness, 5cm diameter). It was the first time I had ever handled such a huge piece of thick skin, and I was really intrigued that this piece of thing was produced by my own body.\n\nHandling it just made me more curious because it had this firm but malleable texture that reminded me a bit of beef jerky. Then, the thought popped into my head: what would it feel like if I chewed it? So I did just that. \n\nI was right - it was chewy in an addictive way. There was just this resistance about the skin that made it so fun to keep chewing, so I just kept chewing on it lol.\n\nNo I didn't eat the skin, but I would probably chew on it again if I had more tbh.",

I just kind of need some advice, harsh or nice, I am not the victim of the story and I am well aware that I\u2019ve made a mistake that isn\u2019t okay.\n\nI\u2019m a reptile owner of many, I\u2019ve literally never rehomed any of my reptiles and have always rescued my reptiles from neglectful situations. I\u2019ve always fed them, housed them, and ensured what time I had with them was pleasant.\n\nRecently I\u2019ve been noticing I wasn\u2019t cut out for one of my rescues. I rescued him from someone else literally off of facebook marketplace, [I felt so bad for him,] and tried to give him a good life. He was an extremely flighty gecko, a look don\u2019t touch. I couldn\u2019t clean his cage or even put food within his cage bc of how flighty he was, and it made keeping him healthy and his space clean hard. Extremely difficult. And that\u2019s not his fault at all. He had a spacious enclosure with lots of hiding spots to keep cover from the naked eye, which I thought would alleviate his stress. But regardless it didn\u2019t, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s due to his previous owner/s. \n\nRecently we\u2019ve been having some wonderfully hot weather so I made an irrational decision to let him loose. No one wanted him when I tried to humanely rehome him and it was growing bad for him and I. He genuinely seemed so much more relieved once out of his enclosure in my yard.\n\nBut now he stays in this one tree outside my house. Literally, I go check on him every day. He seems to be doing well, still flighty and does not want to be touched or caught. He\u2019s bright colors, often like I\u2019d see when he was relaxed hanging out in his enclosure, or when he was enjoying high temps. \n\nIdk. I know this isn\u2019t humane and I\u2019d NEVER make this choice again..it\u2019s so cruel and I hate myself for it, but at the same time he is genuinely thriving without living in that enclosure, and I see him daily even though people don\u2019t know about it.\n\nI just wanted to confess this to someone else to read lol. I haven\u2019t told anyone. I feel horrid. I would never make this choice again even with the hardest reptile. I just thought it was the best choice, and idk what I was thinking. I miss him a lot. He\u2019s not dead, and is doing well where he is, but I still feel immense dread and guilt.\n\nI\u2019m reuploading this merely because I just want people to read it, share an experience, share advice, whatever it provokes other people to do. Because it\u2019s genuinely bothering me that I made this choice but I felt it was for the better. He seems so much happier and I just feel guilt because it\u2019s traditionally extremely inhumane to do this. ",

    "text": "Uh this is my first ever post and I just feel like I need to get this off my chest. I will not be mentioning how old I am or any personal details about me as ik my family members use Reddit a lot to read AITA or the confessions. I was first touched at the age of 3 or 4 by my dad, It made me a very sexual child. Id fantasies about being an adult with a curvy body and I'd masturbate quite a bit. Back then I didn't understand what I was doing wrong because yes I would get caught. I would get in so much trouble but for some reason I couldn't help myself. I would wait until I was alone or when everyone was asleep. Well I vividly remember one night I was trying to sleep and I couldn't so I decided to touch myself. And as I was I saw my dad walk down the hallway, so I tried to pretend I was asleep so he wouldn't yell at me to go to sleep, well he ended up coming into my room and rubbing my body and my butt while. I asked him what he was doing (bare in mind I was like 3-5) he told me to shut up and then asked what I was doing, and why was I still awake. I told him I don't know and that's when he rubed inbetween my legs. I squirmed and then he left. I went to sleep maybe an hour later just to wake up again in a different bed with my pants down later in the night. He would leave and then come back to touch me. I remember crying almost every night knowing he was touching me there and I was too scared to tell anyone because he was also very mean to me. He would tell at me constantly. He would hit me. He would bully me all the time and then at night would touch me while I was asleep while my mother slept in the room next door. One day my mother said that we were moving and me and my siblings where all excited. I thought finally maybe I can get away from him and be okay. But when we moved it happened more. And two other family members on his side touched me as well. My older cousin made me lay on top of him while he grinded against my private parts while my younger cousin slept right next to us. And my uncle put his hand down my pants and touched me while sitting right next to my aunty (his wife, my dads sister). At this point I knew it wasn't right. But it wasn't until sex ed in grade 6-7 where I learnt what SA was. That's when I knew it was wrong. What they were doing was molestering me from a young age, yet still I was afraid to say anything so I kept quiet. I would smile and be happy while silently crying on the inside. this continued for years, my dad touching me more often my cousin and uncle only did it once from what I remember. But my dad continued to touch me for years after. It didn't stop till I was 14 or 15. I was in my room trying to sleep and that's when  he came in and tried to bribe me with my phone (mune and my siblings phones got taken off of us) saying \"I will give this back to you if you do me a favour. It will only take five minutes\" I knew what he wanted but I tried to play it off saying back \"what is it? A job? Like cleaning?\" He wouldn't tell me what if was and just kept saying that it would be quick and only take five minutes. He then tried to get on my bed and touch me but I jumped off and said \"no I know what you want and I don't want to. Stop\" and I walked into the lounge, all the lights were still on and my sister was watching tv on the couch. I pretended that everything was fine and sat next to her. He got very mad with me the look in his eyes where as if I had stabbed him almost like a \"how dare you\" and he took it out on me the next day making me do loads of chores and yelling at me. My mother yelled at me a lot that day too.\n\nVery sorry this is long. There is so many more incidents that I could definitely talk about but I feel this is so long already. I'm very sorry again and I understand if no one reads this I just really needed to get it off my chest. \n\nEdit: I only posted this a few minutes ago and already so many have given some kind words and advice. Thank you sm I will respond as much as I can. Also forgive me on the grammar. And spelling mistakes english isn't my first language I translated most of it through chat gpt and google.\n\nEdit #2: hello guys, thank you so much for your kind words and advice. However I keep debating whether I should have posted or not as I am getting very questionable DMS. I've just had a person say \"so you think your dad was right for touching you?\" I replied with \"no why are you asking\" to which they responded \"he must have felt strong urges to do that\". I asked why they were messaging those things and I got no reply I infact think they blocked me. I wish I could put in a screenshot but I don't know how. I'm sorry if my story had made people upset or mad. But this is my truth and I would appreciate it if I didn't get those sorts of messages. Thank you \n\nEdit#3: hey guys so a lot of you have been telling me to tell someone and I should have mentioned that I did tell one person. They were my closest person and I would talk to them about everything. They unfortunately moved far away when I was still little and they cut off the whole family I never knew why. I would try to reach out but it's like they fell off the earth. I miss them dearly and hope they are doing well but I still feel hurt sometimes as they haven't reached out after years.

    "title": "I lost my best friend and I don\u2019t know how to make things right",
    "text": "Warnings: mentions alcohol use, suicide, abuse\n\nI lost my best friend and I don\u2019t know how to make things right \n\nI (27F) had a friend from middle school through the first year of college - I\u2019ll call her Shayla. \n\nShayla was a rock for me during a difficult period of bullying in middle school and part of high school. At the end of high school into college my anxiety and insecurity was getting bad. \n\nFreshman year of college I noticed Shayla started pulling away and our friendship changed. She got her first serious boyfriend who happened to live in the same dormitory on the same floor as I did, and she would come and go a lot without us seeing each other. She started going to a lot of social events with mutual friends that other close friends were included in, but I was excluded from. She started prioritizing some newer friendships, some with people that made me uncomfortable and openly made fun of me during gatherings. I started to cling to other circles of college friends and ignore it as best I could. I wanted to talk about it with her but didn't know how. \n\nTowards the end of that first year of college Shayla\u2019s partner\u2019s roommate, someone all of us in both circles knew very well since they lived in that same floor, ended up taking his own life. It was a terrible time, and it somehow created a weirder rift. I barely spoke to her the rest of that year. \n\nThe second year of college my anxiety was very bad and I started freaking out over little things that happened, and lashing out in small ways. \n\nExamples: Shayla unadded me on Snapchat, so I unadded her on Twitter. She'd post about a gathering with people from the first year that I didn't even know about, so I'd make a post about doing something with different friends. \n\nOne day I was walking to a meeting for a student group I was in. I passed her while she was walking with another friend, and neither of us said anything at all or even acknowledged each other. I was anxious about it and the same night I texted her asking to hang out, and she said she couldn't that weekend, but would take a rain check. I ruminated on it intensely, to the point where I felt physically sick, and then that same day I went nuclear. I just blocked her number completely. I also deleted my social media because I was tired of seeing everything happening around me while I was sat up alone in a dorm most days. \n\nIn the next few months there was a social event both Shayla and I were invited to, and attended. We said nothing to each other. To make it worse a few of the people there were ones who had talked crap about me and bullied me during those earlier school days. Some friends later asked after that interaction why I didn't talk to her anymore, and I lied and said it was because she was talking crap about me. I didn't actually know that to be the case. I was so anxious about how quickly our friendship deteriorated, and how much I was shut out by her and the friends from that first year, that I didn't know how to explain what had happened. \n\nOne day towards the end of that second year of college Shayla actually emailed me asking if I wanted to hang out with her and and another mutual friend. I was really happy to hear from her, especially after such a difficult year, and I emailed back apologizing that my phone \"wasn't working\" (remember, I had blocked her) and saying I'd love to, asking about where and when. I never heard back. At that point I was distraught and feeling very alone so I went nuclear again and deleted her number. \n\nFast forward to the last year of school - I had reached a point where I had tried anything and everything to cope with my anxiety (except what I actually needed which was therapy, and maybe medication). I ended up using alcohol a lot and it led to a bad cycle of not taking care of myself, shutting people out, and overthinking absolutely everything - and of course it also made the anxiety worse. \n\nI was drunk at a party one night and ended up ranting to someone at the party. I didn't remember most things from that night but came to find out later that I had ranted about Shayla, and said she was talking crap about me and had said something bad about a different friend - we ll call her Andrea. That wasn't completely untrue; Shayla and I both gossiped with each other in high school and would say stuff to each other about other people like Andrea, who she had said some things about. But I shouldn't have said it at the party regardless.  Shayla and the Andrea weren't close and hadn't seen each other in a few years, but to this day I feel bad about causing a rift between them of any sort. Andrea asked me about it later that last year of college a few months after the party and I didn't correct it - I just reinforced the sort-of-lie, which I feel made it worse.\n\nThen came the end of college - shortly after graduation Shayla emailed me saying she felt bad we grew apart, asking if I wanted to meet up. I sent an email back apologizing for any hurt I caused since I had no idea if she had tried to reach out over phone, and that I was glad to hear from her. We met up and talked. She asked about me thinking she was gossiping about me. I apologized and was straightforward that being shut out by her and the group she was with was what made me paranoid that she was talking crap, but that I hadn't heard anything specific. She asked me if it had anything to do with her saying something about the Andrea and I said no. While that was true, that me ghosting her had nothing to do with something she said about Andrea, I didn't come clean about having said that at the party (I assume the person I was talking to at the party circulated it to where it got back to her). \n\nWe talked more about what had gone on in those few years - both of us had some difficult romantic relationships, covid had happened, etc - and then we parted ways. I know we won\u2019t be friends again and I feel I\u2019ve done everything I can to bring closure with her personally, but I wish I had handled things so differently and just talked to her early on about how I was feeling. \n\nThe thing I feel that I really left unresolved is telling Andrea that I had said Shayla was talking crap because I was hurt, and not because she actually was. I don't know how to come clean to the Andrea because it isn\u2019t black and white, but I feel it was lie and I don\u2019t know if/how it\u2019s affecting their rift or the opinions of others in our general social circle. \n\nAndrea is also someone who has not historically been the most trustworthy friend for me which comolicates things. \n\nLong Example: I had a horrible romantic relationship experience my last year of college involving abuse that I don\u2019t want to get into the details of, and which caused me to seek therapy for the first time (which I guess is a silver lining). That \u201cpartner\u201d (if you can call him that) ended up going around to anyone that would listen asking them what I had said about him (I\u2019d said nothing, I wanted to pretend nothing had happened and move on with my life) and then saying very horrible things about me. Andrea told me he\u2019d said horrible things but wouldn\u2019t specify what they were, then later in the year she invited me to go out with her so she could bring another friend, we ll call her Tina, in the hopes I would go on my own rant about the relationship (which I didn\u2019t do). I know this because the same day Andrea invited me out I got a long text from the former \u201cpartner\u201d, after months of no contact, saying he wanted to know how I was doing, and had been thinking of me. I didn\u2019t respond. I also knew because Shayla and Tina spent that outing asking by me vague questions about how I\u2019d been doing, who I\u2019d heard from recently, and looked visibly disappointed when the outing ended with me having said nothing about what happened. \n\n\nToday I have healthier friendships with people I met at a better time in my life and a new romantic partner that I love, and that has stuck with my through intense anxiety which makes me hopeful that I can have healthy, long lasting relationships in general. I\u2019ve done counseling a couple times and recently set up my first psychiatry appointment to find a more permanent solution for anxiety, overthinking, self esteem, and general emotional struggles. I have been very intentional about not gossiping, being more responsive to friends, and proactively reaching out to people - even when it\u2019s awkward and something is bothering me. Shayla has a romantic partner and is engaged, and from what I can tell seems to be doing well which I\u2019m very glad about.\n\nIs digging this back up and clearing the air with Andrea is the right thing to do - and if it is, how to approach it? I don\u2019t want her and Shayla\u2019s rift to impact their well being, or their social circle around them, regardless of whether or not they were close. Part of me feels it would be good to come clean about why I said what I said at that party, the other doesn\u2019t trust Andrea and doesn\u2019t know if I\u2019d just be opening an old wound. \n\nWhat do you think I should do? Any advice is helpful. Sorry for the length and appreciate anyone who can weigh in.",

    "text": "I am really young, I admit it. Since I entered pre-adolescence, those subtle tastes or strange signals from childhood became a dark part of my personality. It was obvious from the moment I thought \"Nobody should know this about me\" and reluctantly erased those twisted thoughts from my mind. I have always felt a great fascination with master-pet relationships, cannibalism, some topics related to the feederism community, vampirism, a small obsession with control in ways as twisted as you can imagine. In my mind, it is really attractive to maintain control and a certain sense of ownership over someone, to the point of perhaps depriving that person of their physical freedom (you know what I mean and it's not pretty) and keeping them by my side as if they were an animal with no voice or vote in my decisions. It's one of the reasons why it's too difficult for me to form deep bonds or genuine connections; it's understandable, even I know how creepy it can be. I know perfectly well that I am sane; social interactions are simple and I can keep my desires perfectly isolated for as long as necessary. They don't harm my friendly or family relationships, as I would never let anyone find out about my twisted tastes. Deep down, I know I'm someone lacking human values with which I can identify, but that doesn't mean I don't want a conventional relationship like that of a happy couple. Unfortunately, I have always rejected people who fall in love with me because I know how terrifying it could be to confess to my special person how much I like to drink my own blood or show them all my sadomasochistic fantasies. I wouldn't want them to stop seeing me as \"the intelligent boy in class, the responsible brother, the pretty boy without a sense of humor\" to start seeing me as the next Jeffrey Dahmer. I can form genuine affection connections that exclude a part of my essence, but I know they will never fully satisfy me and that makes me somewhat sad... Very sad. I would never do anything to harm someone, but if I had the opportunity to make my most disgusting desires reality, I still wouldn't do it; nobody should suffer because of the sick mind of a boy who received a late sexual education. I would like to meet someone with whom to share that part of me that I keep silenced daily, someone who instead of judging it takes the time to understand it and in a way, enjoy it (no, I don't mean committing bloody acts; a simulation perhaps, nothing that involves causing real harm), but I understand that most people don't find it pleasant to have a human pet and I know I'll be perfectly fine without a double life in which I become a serial killer to satisfy my emotional voids of disgusting things. And by sharing I don't mean anything explicit through images or anything sick, I'm talking about metaphors, writings, stories, and personal experiences. I love drinking my own blood, but I wouldn't tolerate explicit visual content of that action. I don't like seeing people harm themselves; as much as a certain part of me feels strangely good, my sane side never lets me frequent such content or promote it. I'm not justifying the fact that yes, my tastes are disgusting, I don't recommend them as a healthy or wholesome practice and I am someone who genuinely enjoys these things because I probably have some kind of trauma that I'm unaware of, so I don't romanticize the actual practice of such acts and I take full responsibility for all my actions, none directed with the purpose of harming someone else, only myself to a slight extent. I've preferred to live pretending that I'm aroace rather than facing my own reality and that doesn't make me happy, but I think it's the right thing to do. I am a pervert and I try to hide it from everyone who knows me.  \n",

    "text": "Hi guys, today I want to share about the desicion that took in my life which changes my life the way I think I way I thought everything. This is not a forceful decison or an influential. It's all on me only. The decision is I want to get married to my love of my life.\n\nHere's the story in 2017 during inter I went to my frnd home she invited me as there was a pooja I went there everything is well until there's a guy of her relative came there and just had a look we had then after lunch I came back to home all is well. But suddenly the very next day that guy came near to my home I got shocked \ud83d\ude33 my family and me are going to another function to some other place then at the afternoon I got a call from an unknown number I lifted that call nd shockly this is him who I saw in the morning. Then we talked how you got the number. Later we spoke at the very fast meeting he told me to get married.\n\n I was shocked we have age gap nearly 7 yrs. I told no let's just be friends and then will see. After that I didn't talk to much because I am busy with my studies. Later I had an another meeting with him in my frnds home. He is too fast to touch and want to take the things fast. I told I am not that much interested.then  I left the place after some time. Then we start talking to each other . Then met with an accident. I prayed alot to the god to get good health because I am having an positive thoughts on him. \n\nHe recovered and he can't able to lift his hand bcz hand got facture. Later we talked and small small meeting we got I thought things are good on going I shared at first only that I am bit angry person and he told me that yes I will handle you. \n\nBut things got changed on new year 2019 I waited a long tym to talk but he is busy in some other call.till morng 3 am I am in waiting only. Early he called and talk like nothing happened I got broke I cried alot I injured my arm also still he is not reacted like I did a mistake. Then after he didn't even say sorry for his mistake instead he portrayed like my behaviour is the reason. \n\nFine on that jan 1st day of the year mine was a bad still I forgive him and talk but he is not in a position to understand what's his mistake. The remaining will be continued...",

    "text": "This was in Gurgaon, near Galleria market and I used to stay in a posch society behind it. I had casually booked a ride not thinking much. \n\nWhen the cab arrived, I saw a hot af girl just browsing her phone, sitting in the back seat. I scooted inside and casually said hi. She responded with a nonchalant hey and we got chatting. She seemed cool and had decent conversational skills, esp after being that hot.\n\nI played it cool, didn't try to put in too much effort. When she started asking questions about my work and lifestyle, I knew she was interested. I asked what her plans were and she said she was gonna go to the mall. I asked her about LinkedIn and connected. I had a premium membership and her phone number was public. \n\nA few seconds later, she gets a text on her phone telling her about where she was and where she was headed. While she was spooked, I as her co-passenger kept talking with her coolly. I asked if there was something bothering her and she relented quickly. I consoled her and told her to block the guy, but she didn't ;)\n\nWhen she was getting out of the cab, I admitted it was me on the other side and I was just pranking her. She was a little angry but definitely impressed. I told her that since I already had her number, it was customary to ask her out for a date. She hesitantly agreed and I asked her if she wanted to go out then and there.\n\nAfter about 13 drinks and lots of smokes later, she was back at my place, frisky, horny and ready to fuck. And fuck we did. Hers was the plumpest ass I had still ever fucked. This was in 2017 and it's been 8 years now. Guess who's booking flights from Bangalore to Delhi for next week. ;)",

    "text": "CW// mention of non-consensual touch, substance use, and possible addiction.\n\n-\n\nI feel really sick to my stomach thinking about it, so I guess that's a good thing.\n\nAt a group sleepover (20F), we all got high and drunk in the same night, which honestly should've been reason enough for me to stop. Especially as the group's hard-weight while my friends are more light-weights. Before we went to bed, I laid down on a friend's (20F) leg and asked them to play with my hair. Their hands began to get more aggressive and my hand reflex squeezed their thigh, the pressure only increased so with my delusion, I assumed they liked it. That plus asking them if they felt comfortable and the one of the responses back being a wink, I thought I was in the clear. In fact, I assumed I was encouraged.\n\nSo not long after, I let my hand wander to their upper thigh, their stomach, and their chest, all while people were trying to sleep around us too. After touching/brushing those areas, I couldn't get another answer if they were comfortable or not and if I could continue touching there; so I stopped but they stopped being comfortable quite a while prior. \n\n*They messaged me last night and I don't think they weren't into it at all. I doubt a single part of it. I went on for so long. Though some responses might've been misleading in my eyes, I could never get a flat out yes from them and now I know exactly why. I shouldn't have touched them without a flat out yes, but I was too caught up in my own emotions to care about that. I was selfish and didn't fully consider if they weren't into it the way I was. Dumb note, but I'm also a virgin, the most virgin in the group, so maybe I was just that desperate or clueless to stoop that low for any action.\n\nI feel so disgusted with myself to have made them uncomfortable. Honestly, I'm wondering if I'm having a sex/masturbation and weed addiction that's feeding into all this, and I accidentally took it out on them? I had to apologize while a bit high (**got high not expecting the message a few hours later) and I'm worried I sounded fake as hell because of it. Sometimes the only motivation I have day to day are those two things. It's not an excuse but it might be a reason and I feel gross knowing that. I feel gross even wanting to get off after this.\n\nThey're in my main friend group I've had since High School. I don't know why I decided to risk this, I just wish I never did. Especially as someone who's also been uncomfortable being touched by somebody. Yes is yes, no is anything else.\n\n-\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you for the genuine replies, just wanted to confirm that I've already apologized to this friend. \n\nIn the morning, I asked maybe once or twice if I made them uncomfortable and they said no, but that was to brush it off. After they left, I messaged them and asked if they were uncomfortable and I'd never do it again if they were, and they said they didn't care too much of it and it's a one time thing we can sweep under the rug. A few nights pass until they confronted me last night. That they never gave explicit consent for me to start nor continue, how close my hands got, and the nerve I had doing this in front of our friends. I sent quite a few messages apologizing back, absolutely on their side, and that I feel remorseful. It's currently left on delivered. I just hope they don't feel unsafe around me, though it's very fair if they do.\n\n-\nEdits:\n\n*added another line for clarification that me and my friend have already addressed this.\n\n**clarification that I didn't get high to apologize to them! i immediately stopped puffing once they opened the convo and I didn't continue smoking until hours after the conversation was over. I wanted to be as sober as I could be for the conversation.\n\n+note: other times I asked them for their comfortability, it was often left unanswered, instead stating how intoxicated they were. I should've stopped there. I only let my hands roam further than the outer leg after the wink as that was my most clear answer, which still isn't a full yes. + I asked about the wink afterwards, they said they couldn't remember answering like that.",

    "title": "Everything Ive ever achieved in life is because of c\u00f6caine",
    "text": "It sounds crazy but it\u2019s true. Long story short is I\u2019ve been suicidal and depressed since I was 9 years old (Currently I am 21F). In school I did ok and got into an average uni. In uni I really realised how depressed I was because I was alone and my parents weren\u2019t there to take care of me. I was spending 4 straight days in bed not doing anything and I failed a bunch of exams first semester. By this point I had tried concerta, fluoxetine and sertraline. I went to my gp and she put me on citalopram. However I had exams coming up and I couldn\u2019t really wait 6 weeks for the citalopram to kick in so I started doing c\u00f6caine. I had done it once before at a party and it made me so happy so I did it again. \n\nI remember that day so specifically. I was no longer tired and my body didn\u2019t feel like a million bricks. The voice in my head that kept telling me to go kill myself for the past 11 years if my life disappeared. I never felt better. And so I started doing it everyday. I went from lying in my bed for 4 days straight to spending 10 hours at the library studying. Anyway I learnt a whole years worth of stuff in about 3 weeks. Id do cocaine everyday about 5 times (a little line each time) And I passed my exams! And when I went back to my home country for the summer for 3 months I was sober. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t too bad being sober. Because now that I knew what not being depressed was like even when I sometimes felt suicidal I kept telling myself that life isn\u2019t that bad. For my second year of uni when I came back I found it impossible for me to study. And with the winter coming I found myself barely able to get out of bed and suicidal again. So what do I do? Cocaine. And again it fixed my life. I got my shit together started going to class and studying. Ofc I don\u2019t have all the money in the world. So I\u2019d pace myself. 3gs every month. So if I had little left and a week left till my next re up I\u2019d save it or not do some for few days. Id ration my coke for the month. \n\nAnd yeh. That was like 2 years ago. I still do coke everyday. I do other drugs too Ofc but recreationally. All bc of coke I am now a star student. All my professors love me. People come to for help with their assignments. All my grades are A\u2019s. I\u2019ve learnt so much and I am a very scholarly person now all thanks to coke. Ofc doing coke everyday is no way to be. It\u2019s expensive, its bed for my heart etc. but I don\u2019t know how else to be. \n\nI am very close with my parents and they\u2019re super strict Muslims. So strict that they don\u2019t believe in psychological medication. When I was 16 and I started taking sertraline my mom and my dad both called me a drug addict (haha foreshadowing) and when they learnt that it didn\u2019t work they told me that I wasted their money and that everything going on is in my head. And they forbade me from taking any kind of other medication. Ofc when I turned 18 I went to my gp (I live in the U.K.) and she prescribed me bunch of stuff but nothing worked on my brain. I kind of resent my parents. Because they don\u2019t realise \u00a3200 missing from my bank account every month but they\u2019d get so mad if they found out I talked to a therapist or took any medication. So in a way they made me an addict. \n\nI feel so ambivalent. I know coke is bad but I don\u2019t know what else to do. No psychological medicine is allowed because of my parents and even if they did allow if I\u2019ve tried so much shit I don\u2019t think anything will work. But I don\u2019t know what else to do. I\u2019m sober if I\u2019m not studying or doing uni work. But there\u2019s still 2 years more to my degree. I\u2019m conflicted. \n\nEDIT- Ik some people will say I\u2019m justifying my addiction bc of my parents. But they are a huge reason why I\u2019m doing coke. If I was on anti depressant, I can\u2019t stop overnight and go on holiday with them. I\u2019ll have withdrawal and start throwing up. With coke I just hide the coke in the house and go on holiday feel perfectly fine. \n\nAlso regarding adhd, a private diagnoses is \u00a34000 and I am financially reliant on my parents and they would never pay that much for a adhd diagnoses. They don\u2019t realise \u00a3100 missing every month tho. My parents also check my phone and messages. I can hide one text to my dealer every month from my parents. I can\u2019t hide multiple calls and emails and texts from psychiatrists or doctors or people calling to confirm an appointment. And if you say don\u2019t give them your phone. If I don\u2019t they psychically hold me down and take my phone away from me and check my phone, messages, pictures, everything. So yeh. Idk what to do. And I can\u2019t draw a boundary between them bc like I said they\u2019ll just take my phone away as soon as I try to set boundaries. ",

We would get high in her car during our breaks and use receipt paper to write messages back and forth that would often send us into mad giggles. I actually still have some somewhere haha.. I remember literally having to hide my head under the till desk because I could not contain my laughter (think desperately holding back laughter while getting into trouble by teachers at school lol) while a decently sized queue - at one of the most busiest periods of the day - waited for me to begin scanning. I think I pretended I dropped a pen or some shit so i could pull myself together\ud83d\ude02\n\nAnyway context given, time to confess my crimes..\n\nI liked scanning fast, much of the time way too fast for the scanner to pick up on the item. That would usually mean you pull item back and rescan till it beeps. But my friends **imaginary for legal purposes and post rules** who had been on tills longer than me would purposefully not scan a decent amount of my shopping anytime I was lucky enough to shop while they were on. So I had to pay it forward obviously! Family, friends and strangers alike all struck luck anytime they queued at my till and had a nice surprise when the amount wasn't as much as expected. \n\nMy **imaginary** friends also showed me how we got our free alcohol for the weekends... one of us would go in when we knew another was on tills and pick up a few bits including our preferred bottle of spirits and mixers etc. Anytime anyone bought alcohol a warning about age restricted items would pop up and we either had to click that they were 'of age'/ or that they were underage/ had no ID. It all sounded and looked the same to shift leaders, other than we usually take the alcohol away if we cant verify legal age. But we would just click underage/no ID, pretend we pressed the other option and slide that glass bottle on down to be bagged up with the rest of the stuff (that we would pay for lol) No one was ever any the wiser \ud83e\udd78 \n\nManagement were bellends and I walked an hour into my last shift after a disciplinary meeting about a shift I had taken off after a cousin took his own life. This was only 6 months after losing my first love in a car accident so I was retriggered about that and obviously devastated over this family loss.. so they weren't happy I was taking time off again after all the time I'd had off when my boyfriend died. So I quit there and then and walked out. Place was so toxic and cliquey! \n\nAlso while I worked cafe they served fish that had maggots and there were tiny flies in every vinegar bottle.. was the worst part of supermarket to work! My next job was in a seafood factory and honestly still one of my favourite jobs I've worked. Except in winter.. omg those 5am freezing cold starts were brutal. \n\nI hereby declare my remorse (as stated in post rules lol) I'm so so so remorseful and sorry for my crimes \ud83d\ude4f Thank you for reading ",

    "text": "Met him when I was 15 (f) and he was 19. At subsequent camps, though there was never any flirting or ANYTHING weird on his part, we had a spark. Whilst barely knowing each other had a conversation that lasted over 3 hours one time. I got fanny flutters at the prospect of just seeing him- its hard to put to words how incredibly attractive I find this man. His smile makes me want to melt into the ground and never get up again. Im now 18 and I havent seen him for a year but I feel the exact same way and have never been able to forget about him.\n\nCONTEXT: I met him during a time in my life when I felt incredibly lonely and thinking of him I know was a way of escaping the emptiness I felt around me. But what I felt for him I think was totally real and to this day ive never felt similarly about anyone else. Now when I think about him it just makes me sad because realistically we have no chance of being together anytime soon and he doesnt really seem interested in me much, the times we occasionally message. But he also doesn't know I've turned 18 so wouldn't have to feel weird anymore about showing interest?  So maybe things would be different if I could find a way to tell him? Or am I just kidding myself? But I can't stop thinking we'd be amazing together.\n\nI would love if some kind soul could give me a bit of honest advice. Sorry for the rant.",

    "text": "Back in middle school \u2014 and well into high school \u2014 me and my best friend were really in to phreaking, prank calls, etc. It was all harmless stuff to keep ourselves entertained. Most pranks were based on challenges such as \u201chow long can you go.\u201d The idea was to keep the other party on the phone for as long as possible. Our record was ~ 23 minutes to order a single pizza. \n\nMy friend had multi-line phones at his house (one ISDN, and 3 regular landlines) so we decided to start doing conferenced prank calls. We\u2019d often dial 6 digits, switch to the second line and dial 7, then switch back and dial the final digit, and connect the two random people or stores.\n\nOne day we decided to have some fun. We wrote up a script \u2014 along with talking points and possible questions from the employees \u2014  and called up several Wendy\u2019s locations around town with the same spiel: \u201chello, please get the manager, and hold for corporate.\u201d It took us a couple hours to call every location (in groups of 4) with managers who were present. \n\nThe pitch went something like this:\n\n\u201cThis is Wendy\u2019s corporate franchise development. We\u2019re losing sales to McDonalds because we don\u2019t have a Big Mac equivalent. That changes today. \n\nWe\u2019re giving each location an opportunity to create something to go up against the Big Mac. We thought the \u2018Big Wendy\u2019 might turn off customers, so we\u2019re calling it the double-double Wendy Wendy for now. \n\nYou have one week to work together to create your own version of what you think a Big Mac competitor should look and taste like. Starting next Friday, and throughout the following week, a customer will ask for two double-double Wendy Wendy meals. You will ask them what kind of beverage they would like, then instruct them to pull aside while you prepare their meal. You\u2019ll make two double-double Wendy Wendys, and serve them with two Biggie fries and two Biggie drinks of their choice. They will not be charged for this.\u201d\n\nMost of the questions were along the lines of \u201cwhat should we do for sauce, and what about the middle bun?\u201d We told them to think of something, as that\u2019s part of the fun, and the winning recipe would net everyone a healthy reward. \n\nFlash forward to the following Friday, we tried it out. The first location had no idea what we were talking about, so we left. The second one took about ten minutes to bring us our meals, but it worked! We visited 5 more locations that week, and dined like kings.\n",

    "title": "Sort of made horrible prayer, not sure if due to ocd or not",
    "text": "This is going to confuse a lot of people but I\u2019ll try my best. OCD could be tricking me. I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019ll do my best to explain. Warning: there are some extremely sensitive themes including racism.\n\nOCD has caused me to worry about making bad prayers. It is mainly an anxiety of what others would think of if I prayed for something bad. Basically, it can think of something bad, and I can think of why I want it, and say \u201camen\u201d pretty easily. Not sure if that constitutes a prayer really since it is ocd driven, and might even feel more real to me than it actually is, but it gets very complicated.\n\nNone of this makes any logical sense to anyone but me, but to me it makes sense and that\u2019s the issue. My mind invented something where I can pray to pray for something. Yes, that\u2019s right, and it makes no sense. Essentially these ideas for prayers come in automatically. I don\u2019t necessarily choose them. I can somewhat choose how I react, but that is where it gets tricky. OCD also blunts my emotions with certain prayers or makes things feel more real than they are\n\nSo, what happened, is my ocd targeted the theme I was most worried about having a bad prayer about, which was unfortunately racism. In the past, I made a mistake that was racist (I won\u2019t get into what it was here), and I thought about it a lot. I imagined people never wanting to forgive me and saying I deserve to suffer forever. Additionally, worrying about making racist prayers made this go up. It was frustrating, because with ocd it can take what people say too literally. So if someone says: \u201cyou deserve to suffer,\u201d I might be thinking that thinking about it 10 hours a day for multiple months was justified. This made me have a misdirected frustration towards the people I perceived as yelling at me, which was unfortunately people of color.\n\nHere\u2019s where ocd comes in with the prayer obsession. OCD gave me the idea: well you\u2019re so mad at them you could pray for them all to die. Unfortunately, with the prayer obsession I\u2019ve had, I\u2019ve had a bit of a history with doing bad prayers when I\u2019m not feeling great, and I don\u2019t know if that is just part of the ocd or not, or just doing them to do them. One example is world war 3. I don\u2019t want people to get hurt, but when I was feeling horrible I thought \u201cscrew it, I\u2019ll pray for it cause I want to die.\u201d I knew God wouldn\u2019t actually do it, and the normal me didn\u2019t want him to. \n\nThen, and I don\u2019t know why, it seemed extremely easy for a moment to pray for people of color to die, and I actually almost did it, but I stopped myself. This is where the praying to pray comes in. With ocd, if I have a moment where I almost did a bad prayer, my mind \u201csaves\u201d that mindset, and it is possible for me to go back to it any time. So this situation will present itself many times to me. With praying to pray, I can essentially be put back in the mindset at any time no matter what is going on, and by saying \u201camen,\u201d my brain basically magically does it and it feels like the same thing. Because it feels real to me, it seems like the same thing as a prayer. Last night that is what I did for this and I regretted it less than a two seconds later. So basically, I ended up doing a prayer that was racist. This is exactly what happened in that moment.\n\nThis isn\u2019t who I normally am (although my brain would disagree), but in that moment, with magical thinking, I prayed for all people of color to die, out of what my brain said was \u201chatred.\u201d My brain also said I felt genuine hatred, but I don\u2019t think I really do. I think it is all related to a misdirected frustration of feeling like I was yelled at, which stemmed from ocd. After the prayer, all those feelings were immediately gone. I don\u2019t know how messed up my brain was, or how much of a role ocd played. It probably at least blunted my emotions. It sort of came on all of the sudden too, but I did it. I\u2019m really sorry. I don\u2019t hate people of color despite what my brain says, but I feel like I did something really bad. \n\nWhen I sit with what happened and don\u2019t engage with it, it does not feel like a big deal at all. The guilt is almost all ocd driven. So I don\u2019t know if that means there is something I\u2019m missing or not. I might be missing something, but I know what happened in the moment ",

    "text": "My mom was in and out of consciousness; she had a stroke and a brain bleed. She was stable and had experienced the TBI that morning.\nMy mom has a history of seeking younger men. She has even went so far as to have relations with my sister\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s brother who was 23, my mom 49.\nI\u2019ve caught her with so many men. It\u2019s like a fetish. Even the men she\u2019s married are at least 7 years younger. I think it\u2019s disgusting. My mom has a history of mental illness. She loved men who drink and do drugs. She always put men before me and my brothers and sisters.\n\nWhile sitting beside her while she was resting, she was getting all kinds of messages, naturally.\nIn the social media chats and messages, I saw a familiar name of one disgusting, despicable individual of someone I used to know. A manchild. A manchild who is looking to be taken care of by a woman. He has no shame. This person used to want to date me. I kicked him to the curb and he fawned over me for months, even driving 30 miles out of the way to pass my house to see if I had someone over.\n\nHe was sexting my mom. She was entertaining it.\nTo this day, she has no idea that I know. It was really hard to learn this while she was hanging delicately between life and death. She\u2019s made a full recovery (walking, talking, driving, holding a job) since then but I wish I could talk to her about it.\n\nI feel bad for snooping, but I still feel disgusted by all of it. She knows I am sickened i am by him. I want him to have absolutely no access to me by any means. I think about this almost every single day since it\u2019s happened.\n\nHave I violated my mom\u2019s space? I feel like she is perpetually a teenager and needs constant guidance.

    "text": "\n\nI need to talk about this because i feel like it will make me more at peace with it/make my mind clearer. Throwaway because i had my face in the other one. Please ask questions.\n\nIm seventeen. i broke my $h streak after seven months. I was doing so well, told my parents and friends that i was doing so much better and i dont think i could bring myself to ever do it again. my dad frequently says that im obviously doing much better and it makes it hard to talk about it because i dont want to disappoint him.. Did it one night and instantly felt relieved. God knows why.\u00a0 My mum is a classic asian parent, but shes gotten so much better at catering to my emotional and mental needs even though i know the idea to her is confusing. My dad is strict in all the wrong ways, for the wrong things i think. I love them both but they make me feel really at war with myself. I can go into detail about what they have both done if you ask.\u00a0\n\nI am failing year 11, i cant concentrate, my head hurts and i blank as soon as i read too much. My memory is beyond bad, its almost like i am 80 years old.I constantly over sexualise myself because i feel like thats all im good for; but i\u2019m afraid of sex due to only one bad experience. i \u2018m constantly stuck between wanting to be skinny and curvy. Too scared to lose my boobs because its the only thing people acknowledge me for. I get offered money for sexual services, even though i have never offered, and the idea disgusts me. I am stuck on my first boyfriend and he hurt me so bad, and im ashamed that i go back everytime he is bored. I am talking to him currently and its eating at me, i know i am not the only one again. I cant even look or be near another guy anymore, with out instantly leaving/cancelling/ghosting.\u00a0\n\nI am a bad friend and never had a friendship that wasnt fueled by my own jealousy, i guess because im so unhappy with myself. Im a two faced bitch who will do anything for people to like me, but if they dont like me, or we fall out, (or even if i think they will hurt me), i switch up and become so nasty i dont even recognise myself. If someone hurts me even a tiny bit, i will go to the ends of the earth to ruin that persons life, and have.\n\nI go through phases where i want to be gone, and where i cant imagine anything better than life. I just want to make it to my 18th birthday, but its becoming a struggle. I am not sad, i am not angry, i am not tired, i am just nothing. Every morning i crawl my way to the end of the day. Sleeping is the only peace i get. Dont know how long i can go like this. Feeling nothing is almost worse than i was really sad.\n\n",

It's not exactly an excuse, but yea, for context. For most of the game I was quiet, but I spent the last hour on that fight, dying multiple times, yelling, banging the desk. Also it was a around 3 am, which makes me feel even worse, because I disturbed peoples sleep. I'm also mad I lost the track of time and played for around 6-7 hours, and then after I finished I was so anxious and mad after everything I fell asleep at like 5am. The night before was fine, I played for 4 hours, I remembered to set an alarm and finished playing at a reasonable time, and I wasn't raging as much. Most game sessions are fine, but if I encounter a difficult oponent/quest/level my emotions take control. I rage so hard and I often won't give up till I win. Sometimes I also forget to set up a timer like today. I think this is a big wake up call for me, I definitely need a looong break (2 weeks ago I didn't play at all though) and maybe go for therapy, because I definitely have anxiety issues and gaming is one way to occupy my thoughts fully.

    "text": "\n\nI turned 19 today. I still don't know what to type or how to say all this, but I got the news that my mother passed away today.\n\nRecently, I moved to an entirely new state for college. Ever since the age of 10, I have struggled with making friends \u2014 it's not like people don't talk to me, it's just that they only talk when they need favors, like notes or help. I have tried forming close friendships, but for some reason, I have always been treated as if I\u2019m not part of the group.\nI have struggled with my gender identity and sexual orientation growing up too.\nLast year, I got into a good college after giving one of the toughest exams in the country. I had hoped that I would interact with people and try my best to change myself. Unfortunately, college was even worse than my school days. There was a hell of a lot of groupism from the start \u2014 based on what language you spoke. There were two majority languages \u2014 and unfortunately, I spoke neither. Even though I tried, I was alienated from day one.\nI now had no real people to talk to in college; just a few people who spoke to me only when they needed notes or help.\nAt that time, the only thing that kept me sane was talking to my mother. She had always been there for me and never judged me for struggling with all this.\nEvery day, I talked to her for hours and shared every single thing with her.\nI have been suicidal for the past 3\u20134 years, but the only reason I never did anything was because of her.\n\nI don't have a good relationship with my dad. He abused me physically and mentally while I was growing up. Even though now he has realized the error of his ways \u2014 and I would say he knows he was wrong \u2014 the trauma he gave me is too much.\n\nEvery year, I used to celebrate my birthday with my mother only (as I didn\u2019t really have any other close people). I would get a text from 2\u20133 'friends,' so things still felt somewhat okay.\n\nThis year, in college, we have a group chat made specially just to wish birthdays \u2014 but no one cared to wish me.\nI even jokingly told some people the day before that it was my birthday, hoping they would write something in the group \u2014 but no one did.\nYes, I know that's embarrassing, but I was that desperate. I wanted my college birthday to be better.\nWhat's worse is that one of them, whom I had told it was my birthday, texted me \u2014 but only to ask for notes.\nI wished he had just written two words \u2014 just two words: Happy Birthday.\n\nI was waiting for my mother to call and wish me at midnight, but surprisingly, she didn\u2019t.\nI thought maybe she had fallen asleep since she had to work early.\nEven though I was disappointed, I reassured myself because I knew she was the only one who was going to wish me today.\nWaking up in the morning, my dad informed me that my mother had passed away in her sleep (due to natural causes).\nI couldn't believe anything.\nI am still not able to process everything.\n\nBut I know one thing \u2014 the person I lived for these past years is no longer here.\nAnd today, in a few hours:\n\nI will go out for the last time, take a round of my campus (my campus is extremely beautiful, and one of the other reasons I stayed sane),\n\nand then I will come back to my room \u2014 and, hopefully, I will join her too in the afterlife today itself. \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n",

    "title": "Because of something that happened in high-school, at my core I know I\u2019m a monstrous person.",
    "text": "               I am an awful human being. Male in all the ways the men are afraid to be. It would be unfair to all men that share the same hormones and large frame as me to attribute to my awfulness to my gender. But to pretend that my maleness does not influence the aspects of myself of which I am most of ashamed of would be silly.\n               To get more to the source of my self revulsion I have to elaborate on the night where I think I truly revealed myself\u2014 my true heart. At the time I was dating my high-school girlfriend, Rose, and we had plans to stay at her friend\u2019s condo in a nearby city so we could party with people we knew but weren\u2019t too close with. I drove both her and the friend there.\n                At the condo/party I was especially liberal with my drinking. One shot, down went three more, two more with an unholy cocktail of vodka and Mountain Dew Baja Blast, so on and so on. Completely wasted. More drunk than I had ever been before or since. I didn\u2019t remember anything besides the actual act of drinking that night. It was an uncomfortably long gap in my memory. The morning after was a bit hazy as well, but I do remember that something was wrong in my girlfriend\u2019s face. She had been crying and she told me she hadn\u2019t slept.\n                 The ride home was really tense. I kept asking Rose what happened but she wouldn\u2019t say. Not with the friend in the car. After a bit of back and forth through the Notes app on my phone (a note I still have and look at often) we decided to pull over at a gas station to talk.\n                 The conversation that followed was an extremely hard one. Through heavy tears she explained that I had made her and the friend extremely uncomfortable the night before. From her account, I had hit on her friend right in front of her. Repeatedly and pathetically. \u201cHit on\u201d might not be the right phrase as it conjures images of of bachelors trying to \u201cscore\u201d at bars and stuff. The image conjured by what Rose was saying was one of a potential rapist. I was following the friend around the condo, telling her how pretty she was, complimenting her clothes, calling myself her \u201cstep boyfriend\u201d, all culminating in a skin crawling event where I told her \u201cwe\u2019re going to fuck.\u201d Not even a request, a declaration. One with the likely under tones of \u201cwhether you like it or not.\u201d After this, I apparently passed out in the bedroom which Rose and I shared. I think the correct phrase for this situation would be \u201csexual harassment.\u201d\n                 I was convulsing in sobs when she finished. I remember her consoling me which was a kind act I know I didn\u2019t really deserve. She confided that the fact that I remember nothing from that night made it a thousand times more complicated. Does it really though? While I do wish that I could have those memories back just to fully understand why I did and said those things, I don\u2019t think I was a different person. At some core level, those insanely creepy words came from me. Also, the fact that I willingly drank so much represents a choice to dangerously lower my inhibitions. How could I have known though? How could I have known that my true core, one without the mental blocks of inhibitions, was a six foot tall man demanding sex from a woman who thought she could trust him. All things about myself point to a stand up trustworthy guy. Almost all my friends are women, I have two sisters who I practically raised, I\u2019m good friends with all of my ex\u2019s (excluding Rose for understandable reasons), all of those women would trust me with their lives. I get told I\u2019m sweet, charming, thoughtful, a sensitive and empathetic person who really cares. Why then, for that night, was I completely detestable. A wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. No, not even for that night, read the \u201cI\u201ds and \u201cme\u201ds of this post. Complete narcissism. Explaining and excusing an event that was nobody\u2019s fault but my own and having  the audacity to be self pitying about it.\n               Anyways, Rose and I broke up. The breakup wasn\u2019t quick. It was months long with a thousand long talks to see if we could salvage the broken trust. I\u2019ve never loved anyone or anything as much as I loved her which makes the events of that night a tragic point in both of our lives. The friend left for college and no one\u2019s talked to her since. I haven\u2019t seen either of them in years. I know I hurt them both. Not in any physical way but in a lasting mental way. When I try to put myself in their shoes that night (which I do obsessively) I can\u2019t escape the truth. I am a horrible human being",

    "text": "this has been a thing since i f(23) was a kid. i remember when id argue with other girls in school or even go back and forth online, it excited me. i thought this meant this person must like me because they\u2019re entertaining and giving me attention. this is when i realized tension wasn\u2019t just tension in my head. even when i had \u201cbeef\u201d with other girls i still imagine making out with them sometimes instead of fighting. even when i didn\u2019t like the girl. \n\nnow as an adult in the rare instance that i do go back and forth with a stranger online or someone im dating, i tend to say things that bounce off of what they say. i try to find clever replies and when they react to it, i get excited- almost like we\u2019re writing a poem together . i do not enjoy bringing turmoil to others. but after a debate with even someone i may not know online, i be wanting to text them after and hold conversations. often times i get the thought \u201cis this person flirting with me\u201d which i laugh it off. but i can\u2019t help but to feel a little intrigued or turned on going back and forth with other people. gender doesn\u2019t matter and i don\u2019t even have to know what the person looks like. if lm (sleeping with, dating, talking to, focused on, etc), to someone i can easily feed into the drama and drag things out, for the tension to me appears as sexual tension. luckily i have a strong mindset and i don\u2019t personally argue anymore due to my anxiety. but sometimes i can\u2019t tell when im trolling too much and actually bothering people. idk if it matters but i am pansexual so it doesn\u2019t make a difference who im talking to really. \n\nidk if this makes sense. but this is one of those odd ass traits of mine that i can\u2019t just go without telling someone. \n\n(edit: i wonder if anyone understand or goes through the same thoughts)\n(edit 2: i never said i enjoyed starting arguments, on the contrary i\u2019ve specifically stated that i prefer to not argue. it\u2019s just in the instance that i do argue, im more eccentrically equipped) ",

    "text": "\nI\u2019ve lied and gotten away many times about being a twin to people who I\u2019ve just met. I have told countless people over the course of my life I am a twin. I am indeed not a twin. But every time anyone would ask me if I was a twin to someone they saw, I would say yes and never tell the truth. \n\nYou see, I am of mixed race. 50/50 black and white. I don\u2019t see many people like me in my day to day life. In school growing up, it was rare to be in a class or even in a school, with someone who had my exact skin complexion and hair texture. But whenever I did, people would instantly think me and whoever was also biracial, were related. \n\nMy classmate (later friend) and I were sitting in the same group the first day of school when someone asked if we were twins. I instantly said yes but that we have different last names because our parents divorced and decided to surrender full custody of one of us and move away to make it fair. He ran with it and we never told anyone. Even the teacher thought we were telling the truth. I\u2019ve done this numerous times with other biracial people who I encounter and get to know using random lies that sound almost unbelievable but not quite. No one (who didn\u2019t actually know me) has ever suspected me of lying. I do feel bad about certain lies I used because some of my lies were actually kind of dark and happen in real life. I don\u2019t do that joke anymore since I\u2019ve discovered that the real world is not so funny. \n\nEdit: I shouldn\u2019t say I was never suspected by anyone because truly I don\u2019t know that but I was never called out on it if someone did suspect is a better way of saying that.

    "title": "I sh*t and threw up all over myself at college in the public restroom, naked.",
    "text": "Throw away because no one must ever know. I was in college suffering from food poisoning in my freshman year. After tossing and turning for hours, struggling with cold sweats and stomach cramps I finally fell asleep. Suddenly at about 4AM I woke up with the instant need to go. That night my boyfriend was over so I decided to just sleep in my underwear since my roommate was not in the room that night. I was against the wall on those god forsaken twin beds and threw myself over him. Before I could find where I had thrown my shirt it was already too late. I could feel it coming out and there was nothing stopping it. I decided to make a bee line to the bathroom, fortunately I was right next to the public shared rest room. I ran into the big handicap stall to give me as much room as possible. I sat on the toilet and before I could react I threw up all over my already soiled underwear, the floor, and myself. By the time it all subsided I started panicking. I was now in the public restroom, covered in vomit and diarrhea, completely naked. After listening for anyone in the hallway, I made a mad dash over to the showers. I cleaned myself off as fast as humanly possible, listened for anyone again, peaked out into the hallway and upon seeing the coast was clear sprinted to my dorm room. I practically slammed the door shut and flicked on the lights. My boyfriend then sprung to life just to see his drowned rat of a partner, shaking like a leaf, sobbing. He asked what happened and I broke down. He helped me dry off and made sure I was ok before he let me leave, fully dressed this time, to go clean up the floor (I\u2019m not a monster). While cleaning I buried my underwear at the bottom of the industrial trash can and cleaned up the rest of the mess. After being utterly traumatized we decided to have me sleep on the edge fully clothed just in case.  ",

    "title": "Claire and Thomas where the opposite is up to you to see what you think about it",
    "text": "\n\nCLAIRE \u2013 Before him\n\nI was coming out of two long relationships. One too lukewarm, the other too chaotic. I had learned to protect myself. I read a lot about emotional dependence, narcissistic perverts, manipulation mechanisms. I wanted to be \u201clucid\u201d, no longer fall into the traps of disguised passion.\n\nWhen I installed this app, it wasn't to find love. I just wanted to talk, maybe find some human warmth. I wasn't expecting him.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nTHOMAS \u2013 Before her\n\nI was coming back from a breakup that had drained me. I spent months recovering. I did therapy. I read everything I could about attachment, relationships, the mistakes I had made. I was ready to love again, but this time, differently. I promised myself to say what I feel, not to play anymore, not to hide.\n\nWhen I saw Claire, I knew it wouldn\u2019t be a meeting like any other. She had a light. An intensity. And a dark side, too, that I recognized in her as in mine.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nClaire's voice\n\nI met him on a Thursday evening, on an app. From the first messages, there was a kind of rare fluidity. In two hours, we already had private jokes, we shared our dreams, our childhood wounds. He said very beautiful, very profound things, and I had this strange feeling: \u201cEither he\u2019s the man of my life, or he\u2019s going to break me into a thousand pieces.\u201d\n\nThe first meeting, two days later, was perfect. He looked at me like I was the only woman on Earth. He was attentive, funny, attentive. He walked me home. He took me in his arms. I felt seen. And it's been a long time since I felt like that.\n\nBut very quickly, it became\u2026 invasive. Messages from morning to evening. \u201cI miss you\u201d from the second week. Discussions about \u201cour future\u201d, as if we had been together for months. And when I told him that I needed time to breathe, he got upset. He told me that I was putting up walls, that I was afraid of loving.\n\nI asked myself: is he manipulating me? Is he flattering me just to have me under control? He told me about his exes who \u201churt him\u201d, how he was \u201ctoo nice\u201d. I read articles about love bombing. Everything coincided. And then one day he exploded because I canceled a dinner. He told me that I wasn't invested, that I was playing a game. There, I said to myself: that's typical of a narcissistic pervert. He made me feel guilty, even though I was just setting a limit.\n\nSo I ended the relationship. And I was left with this bitter taste: how could something so beautiful become so suffocating, so quickly?\n\n\u2e3b\n\nThomas' voice\n\nWhen I met Claire, I had a shock. She was brilliant, funny, intense. We talked for hours. She knew right away where to touch me. It was like she already knew me.\n\nI wanted to give him everything. I wanted her to know that I was sincere. I wrote him spontaneous messages, I shared my thoughts, my memories, my fears. She responded enthusiastically at first. Then I felt a change. Less present. Less demonstrative. I thought she was moving away. I was scared.\n\nSo I insisted. I told myself that if I did more, she would see that I was there for real. But the more I tried, the more it closed. One day, she told me that I was \u201cputting pressure on her.\u201d That I was doing \u201ctoo much\u201d. Yet I just wanted to show her that she mattered.\n\nThen she started to doubt everything. She once told me that my compliments sounded fake, \u201clike learned scripts.\u201d She asked me if I often manipulate women like that. I was shocked. Hurt. It wasn't a technique. It was me.\n\nAnd when she canceled that dinner, I broke down. I felt rejected, humiliated. So yes, I reacted strongly. Too strong. But I didn't want to lose her. And she left. Without another word.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nWeek 1 \u2013 The obvious\n\nCLEAR\nEverything happened very quickly. The messages were so fluid, funny, deep. He spoke to me as if he had known me forever. He knew how to ask words, questions, listen. He told me I was \u201cobvious\u201d. I smiled, but deep inside I felt a shiver. Who says that so quickly?\n\nTHOMAS\nShe captivated me from the start. Each exchange made me want to know more. She spoke to me with lucidity and modesty, a form of restraint that was beautiful to observe. I let myself go. I said what I felt. I wanted her to know I wasn't playing. That I wanted to build, not just consume.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nWeek 2 \u2013 Intensity\n\nCLEAR\nHe called me every evening. He wanted to hang out, all the time. I was flattered\u2026 then a little worried. He told me \u201cI adore you\u201d, then \u201cI feel like we could live together\u201d. I raised an internal flag: This is love bombing. It's too much, too soon.\n\nBut at the same time, he was so sincere. If present. So I said to myself: give him a chance. And I fell a little more.\n\nTHOMAS\nShe was more distant, sometimes. She took a while to respond. I told myself she was scared. I wanted to reassure her. Show him that I was stable, reliable. I told her that I thought of her often. She responded, but less and less warmly.\n\nI didn't understand. I was afraid she would move away. So I put more energy into it. No more words. Maybe too much.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nWeek 3 \u2013 The changeover\n\nCLEAR\nI started to feel oppressed. He told me that I was running away from intimacy. That I had \u201cwalls\u201d. He got worried whenever I took a step back. I had the impression that he was monitoring my silences.\n\nOne evening, I read an article about toxic relationships. It ticked a lot of boxes. I panicked. I said to myself: What if he was an unconscious manipulator? One of those who love intensity but hate the freedom of others?\n\nI didn't want to go back to being that woman who gets lost.\n\nTHOMAS\nI felt it slipping through my fingers. I just wanted us to really talk. But she was elsewhere. I insisted. I told him I was scared. She said I was projecting too much, that I was invading her.\n\nI felt betrayed. Rejected for my sincerity. I wondered if she was emotionally available. If she wasn't the discreet manipulator, who gets attention then shuts down as soon as she gets it.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nWeek 4 \u2013 The breakup\n\nCLEAR\nI canceled a dinner. He reacted very badly. He criticized me for \u201crunning away from love\u201d, for not being ready. He said I hurt him on purpose. I heard: you are guilty of not loving me the way I want. And then I knew I had to leave. Because I couldn't breathe in this bond anymore.\n\nI told him I needed space. That it wasn't against him. But he didn't want to hear. So I ended it.\n\nWith a strange feeling: that of having fled a danger... or an ill-born love.\n\nTHOMAS\nShe told me I was too intense. That I was suffocating him. She left me by message. I sat there like an idiot, reviewing our conversations. I didn't understand. I reread everything with a cold gaze. And I saw what people call love bombing. I was afraid: What if I was that without knowing it?\n\nBut deep down, I know not. I know that I loved as best I could, clumsily but with heart. And that she also did her best\n\nWhat they didn't see\n\nClaire and Thomas were two sincere souls, but each carried an invisible bag on their back, filled with old wounds, doubts, old terrors. And it is these bags, heavy and silent, which dictated their story as much, if not more, than their true desire to love.\n\nClaire grew up with the idea that love could confine, suffocate, control. Perhaps because she experienced relationships where admiration quickly turned to possession. Perhaps also because we loved her for her visible qualities (her beauty, her intelligence) but rarely for her flaws, her hesitations, her silences. She learned to be wary of those who \u201cwant too much,\u201d because, in her experience, wanting too much necessarily meant wanting to change her, or to possess her.\nSo, when Thomas showed himself to be demonstrative, expressive, full of shared desires, Claire did not see a man who clumsily tried to love her; she saw potential danger. His brain didn't hear \"I care about you\", it heard \"I'm going to grab you\".\nShe did not see that she herself, by moving away to protect herself, was amplifying Thomas' anxiety - which led him to insist even more.\n\nThomas has what psychologists call an anxious attachment. When he feels the connection becoming important, his insecurity rises. He said to himself: \u201cIf I don\u2019t prove right away that I am worthy of being loved, she will leave.\u201d He does not seek to control; he seeks to reassure, clumsily, through excess presence, through words that are too big, too quickly.\nWhen Claire began to take a step back \u2014 which was a healthy way for her to preserve herself \u2014 Thomas did not perceive it as a simple need for space. He experienced it as an imminent abandonment. And in his panic, he did exactly the wrong thing: he squeezed harder.\nHe didn't see that Claire didn't need more attention; she needed time, air, trust left at a distance.\n\nBoth, prisoners of their interpretation, missed the essential:\n\t\u2022 Claire did not see that Thomas was sincere in his awkwardness, that he did not want to invade her but only to be reassured.\n\t\u2022 Thomas failed to see that Claire was not cold or disinterested, but cautious, slow to trust, and that she needed to experience her freedom in order to love.\n\nThey read each other's signs not with their hearts, but with their scars.\nThey put modern words to their ancestral fears: narcissistic pervert, love bombing, toxic relationships, even though they were just two poorly tuned humans, each frightened in their own way.\n\nThey have not understood that love, sometimes, begins precisely where it is scary.\nWhere we should learn to say:\n\t\u2022 \u201cWhen you move away, I\u2019m afraid. But I want to respect your need for air.\u201d\n\t\u2022 \u201cWhen you invade me, I close myself. But I don\u2019t want to reject you, just feel free.\u201d\n\nBut neither of them knew how to put these words together in time.\n\nThen, in the silence of their unspoken fears, the budding love was extinguished.\nNot for lack of feeling. But by excess of misunderstandings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "I may have manipulated a guy into loving me and change his life as well",
    "text": "Apologies in advance as this might be a mess. TempThrowaway acc obv. I'm afraid my partner would find this but I really want to let this off of my chest.\nDuring 2023 while I was browsing on MRM (myreadingmanga) website where a porn ad came thru and that's where something weird happened. I saw a guy that looked really familiar on the intrusive webcam ad and i clicked on it to find out it's my high-school bully. Mind you he's not bully bully but jus annoying, childish, name calling, pulling my pants down kind of bully. At first i couldn't believe my eyes like it can't be him but his username and His IRL name is similar (like Chris XXXson). I watched for a while where he pleasure himself while interacting with the viewers. At first I jus wanted to mess with him a bit but then I was really drawn to him to the point that I created an account, interact with him and even spend money. He's not a big camboy or whatever it's called. Usually it's 2 digits to jus a couple viewers but i was obsessed with him and everytime i got off work. I would look him up, chat with him, send coins. Throughout this I confirmed it's really is him but I was already obsessed with him. After some months later, I learn about him alot and I really want to reach out to him but scared that I would come off as a creep so I tried to reconnect with my old friends to find out about him. After sometimes, i figured out thay he's unemployed, staying with his sister and whereabouts. I hang around his area to see him and i did. I've always thought of myself as a loner who would grow old as a single uncle but seeing him was like something reachable, within my grasp if I make my moves right. I've never had that kind of confidence in anywhere and it felt good. I remember i was shaking with excitement and I knew I gotta do it. And so i did. I try to bump into him at his usual go to convince store and act all surprise and guilt trip him into buying me beer for bullying me in high-school. He was sincerely apologising and all which i find it very cute. I got that beer bar date. There I planned it all out. Joking about old times, reminiscing about high school and all the fun things and then got him to go for a walk in a park with more beer cans in hand with me. I had it all. We couldn't stop talking about everything including his life and where he's been which I already know ofcourse. I comforted him and the next thing i know, he got all emotional and we were making out on the bench at night. I walk him back to his home where his sister is worried sick. The next day, i text him and hit him up. One thing i had to lie at that time was how i knew his number and his address which i got all from a friend. I jus swept it under by saying he was too drunk when he give it to me. From that day on, I hit him up IRL and on that cam website. He always chat about life and whatever topic he has on his mind when there are very few viewers but I was always there. On there as an online stranger, i tried to push him into my way. A lot of things happen during that until one day he really went out on a proper date with me. I was pursuing him in IRL but subtly. I learned more about him during our 2 months where i learn he has a passion for baking but never really got into so I encourage and put him as apprentice in a local bakery using my connections which he is very thankful for. After a while, he announced on the website that he's turning a new leaf and leaving the cam site and I even congratulated him and send him a final tip. He never mentioned about the website to me IRL tho. 8 months of dating in and I had him move in with me, where he would bake breads and pastries for me. We are head over heels for each other. We celebrated 1 year anniversary like 5 months ago and now we're planning to save up money to open up his own shop. My house smells of bake goods and he is trying his best for the shop. Sure i feel like such a manipulator sometimes but I love this man so much. His sister loves me too. It's a little family i got. I aim to marry him next year if all goes well. From jus wanted to mess with him to him making a mess out of me everyday. I want to let this whole thing out to him but i don't even want a single dent in my relationship with him. I cherish him and he knows it. God this was the single bravest thing i ever did and I'm loving it everyday. I sometimes feel like I litreally went with my gut like a villain, a mastermind. I still would love to hear what you guys have on your mind.",

She was super into me way faster than I expected. After two weeks, she was already talking about moving in, naming our future kids, getting matching tattoos \u2014 full speed ahead.\n\nI didn\u2019t have the guts to just tell her it was too much.\nInstead of ending it like a normal person, I made the worst decision of my life:\nI pretended to die.\n\nKinda.\n\nI created a fake Facebook profile pretending to be my \u201ctwin brother\u201d (let\u2019s call him \u201cJake\u201d) and messaged her saying that I had tragically passed away in a \u201cfreak hiking accident.\u201d\nI literally googled a photo of a random mountain and posted it like it was a memorial.\n\nShe was devastated. I felt kind of bad\u2026 but also a little relieved.\nI thought that would be the end of it.\n\nNope.\n\nShe reached out to \u201cJake\u201d constantly. At first it was condolences. Then it was weird things like, \u201cI think you\u2019re the only one who understands my pain,\u201d and \u201cCan we meet to mourn him together?\u201d\n\nIt got so bad that I had to fake \u201cmoving across the country for a fresh start\u201d just to shut it down.\n\nI kept up the lie for THREE MONTHS before finally just deleting everything and disappearing.\nTo this day, she probably still thinks I\u2019m dead.\n\nSometimes I wonder if karma is going to destroy me for it.\nHonestly, I deserve it.",

It's been about 3 days since the last time I prayed.  \nToday, I watched porn and masturbated.  \nToday, I didn't work.  \nToday, I spent the whole day lying down.  \nToday is another terrible day, where the version of me I hate the most takes over.\n\nThis isn't clear to the people around me.  \nMaybe I look almost the same every day from the outside, but deep inside, I know the truth \u2014 and God knows it even better than I do: I'm doing worse than ever before.  \nThis addiction to watching that filth...  \nThis relationship that is Haram...  \nThis wasted time I spend watching random movies...\n\nI don't know what kind of \"me\" I am creating for the long term.  \nI don't see the big picture \u2014 in fact, I don't see any picture at all.  \nMaybe, in the long term, this suffering is making me into the best version I could ever be \u2014 or is it?\n\nDoes being the best version of myself necessarily mean I must always do the uncomfortable, unwanted things, moment after moment, simply to be alive?  \nMaybe that's what it should always be: to choose, at every moment, not the easy and comfy path, but the hard one.  \nWhy?  \nBecause life is short \u2014 *very* short \u2014 unexplainably short.  \nLike the blink of an eye, years pass.\n\nAnd looking back, the question arises:  \n**Was it the best way I could've spent those years?**\n\nI believe in God.  \nI believe in the afterlife.  \nAnd it's the most uncomfortable thing I can think about right now, because it's exactly what I'm running *against* \u2014 running *from* Allah, instead of running *to* Him.\n\nIsn't this our life?  \nA run toward the inevitable \u2014 toward certainty \u2014 toward death \u2014 toward Allah?  \nBut this life is, indeed, the biggest proof of whether we deserve the right kind of eternity or not:  \nEither an eternity of pleasure, of learning, of growing, of getting closer and closer to Allah \u2014 an eternity of gaining knowledge, infinite knowledge...\n\nWhen I now think about it, all of this life seems minuscule.  \nIt makes me question every single thing I do:  \nWhy not just leave everything behind \u2014 escape to a faraway land \u2014 and pray to Allah until death?\n\nAt the very first moment of eternity, all this life will be forgotten.  \nI have already forgotten most of the life I have lived.  \nOnly some moments remain in my mind \u2014 and those moments were captured not just by me, but by others, by things, by beings.\n\nBut Allah sent us the Prophet (peace be upon him) to teach us that this is *not* the way He intended for us to live.  \nAllah wants us to live together, to make the earth a better place, to wonder at what He has created, to marvel at the complexity, to try to understand it, even to try to mimic it \u2014 only to realize that we are, indeed, created.  \nTo see each other.  \nTo accept how different \u2014 and yet how similar \u2014 we are.  \nWe are, indeed, surviving.",

While we're there, they start play fighting in the store.

Which they definitely did, but they were in test limits mode because teenagers. \n\nAt one point, I got really frustrated with them. I exaggerated my speach to make it seem that I was somewhat slow, and started soft yelling at them about how they were acting. \n\nThey started laughing uncontrollably, and the people around us were mortified!!\n\nBut they stopped messing around and we got out of the store shortly after that.\n\nBonus: They stopped messing around in the store when they went with me after that. I would just ask if they want a repeat of the holiday shopping event. \n\nI definitely would not do that again now, but it was the only way I could think of to get them to stop acting like fools back then, and it lasted for a while as a threat to make them act right.

I am overweight (170lbs at 5 foot 3 inches) and it shows. I have always had very strong cravings for particular foods since I hit puberty, and as you can imagine it made me gain weight. I always feel hungry and have issues with not wanting to waste food if I have some left on a plate, so I tend to over eat while justifying it in a number of ways. Ive debated making myself puke out of guilt for eating so much but I dont want to waste good food or the money I spent on it just because I cant control myself. \n\nI havent made myself puke yet but I think I would have just now if I wasnt at work. I dont want my coworkers to potentially hear me. Im scared Ill do it when im at home, and justify it and make it not a big deal when I know its technically a symptom of an eating disorder",
