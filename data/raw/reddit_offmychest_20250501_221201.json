    "text": "Folks, a reminder that [Rule 3](/r/offmychest/about/rules) focuses this community's scope on providing emotional support only. We do not allow solicitation or material offers.\n\nThis means OPs cannot hint at or ask for money, and community members cannot offer money or food. There are local services that can verify and address a person's situation better than any of us can (and many services will not turn people away if they are asking for it). A kind community member offered a scammer a job and that is okay.\n\nThis community is read by millions of people, and scammers around the world know this. We have cultivated an empathic community so we know it can be hard to resist offering material help. It takes only one person to make it worth it because it costs nothing to post. That is why the rules are strictly enforced.\n\nThere are many signs of a scammer. They will present a financially desperate situation often with a highly emotional component. They are likely to mention payment services. They may have payment services in their Reddit profile and ask people to look at their profile. They will ask people to privately message them. All of these behaviors may be obfuscated with weird spacing and other ways to evade detection. If they evade detection it's up to the community to report it. Do not call out OPs, report only.\n\nThank you for your cooperation.",

It\u2019s like I assume no one actually wants to hear the real answer, so I end up second-guessing myself and giving some short, awkward reply instead.  \n  \nDoes anyone else deal with this? Is it a social anxiety thing? Am I just overthinking something most people don\u2019t even notice?",

All the time growing up I'd hear about how us kids just naturally took to computers and they were right. I remember teaching my mom how to set up her first email account when I was like 9 years old. Then years later showing her how to out music on her ipod etc. Everyone my age was proficient with computers right away and being bad at technology was seen as an old people thing.\n\nWell now I'm in my 30s and it's like it's reversed. The younger employees where I work all have to be taught how to do very very basic computer tasks like logging in to windows, using Microsoft Word, using a browser to go to websites etc. And don't get me started on the chicken pecking typing, or using caps lock instead of shift.\n\nThey only know how to use phones and the app store. If there isn't an app for some web service they just straight up don't know how to get there.\n\nTeaching them to use the computer at work feels exactly like teaching the boomers how to use the computer. What is going on??\n\nAnd don't tell me they just know how to use different technology that I don't know how to use. Yes I do. I know how phones work and don't need any help doing anything on them.\n\nI see on reddit all the time people not knowing they can go to reddit on their browser instead of the app.\n\nI listen to 4chan greentext stories on YouTube while I do my paperwork and I've seen comments from people asking how to get the \"4chan app\"\n\nDoes nobody have a laptop or whatever any more? I know that PC gaming is more popular now than ever so young people are definitely getting computers. High end computers at that. Is their whole computer experience strictly limited to Steam and the games they buy there? Do they know about the browser? If they had to, say, download and then open a PDF would they be able to do it?\n\nAre zoomers the new boomers? Don't they teach computer basics in school anymore? ",

I told my mom (who lives out of the country) my graduation date a year ago so she could plan ahead. A few months ago, we found out my brother (who also lives in the States) is graduating a week before me. She said she\u2019d go to his graduation, then travel down to mine, and fly back home the day after.\n\nFast forward to a month ago \u2014 she asked me to pay for plane tickets for her, my sister, and my stepdad, saying her card wasn\u2019t working. (That\u2019s always the excuse) I told her I couldn\u2019t help because I was already tight on money with graduation expenses and bills. She said she\u2019d pay me back within the week, but she has a pattern of borrowing money and never paying it back, so I was hesitant anyway. I also heard she asked someone else for money for plane tickets. Not surprising\n\nNow she\u2019s saying she can\u2019t come to my graduation because our elderly dog (who lives with her) is sick and she needs to go back for him. For context, the dog had already been sick before my brother\u2019s graduation, and she still traveled to see him. Someone is caring for the dog back home, so he would\u2019ve been fine for the extra few days it would\u2019ve taken to attend mine too.\n\nI get it \u2014 the dog is family. But if she could leave him to go to my brother\u2019s, why not mine? She was already in the states. I gave her a year\u2019s notice, and it just feels like she didn\u2019t make any real effort.

    "text": "TLDR: My close friend group (potential bridesmaids) went on a trip without me. Sensing I\u2019d be upset, the planner of the trip called after to \u201ccheck in\u201d to explain why. Now I\u2019m questioning the friendship and their place in my wedding.\n\nI\u2019m struggling with how to move forward after this. I have a group of five close friends who I\u2019ve always considered my core people\u2014so close that they\u2019d likely be my bridesmaids for my 2026 wedding (I haven\u2019t officially asked, but it\u2019s been understood).\n\nRecently, one of them\u2014let\u2019s call her Anna\u2014planned a weekend trip because her parents let her invite friends to the place they were renting. She invited everyone from our group except me. One girl even flew in from out of state. I\u2019ve been talking for months about wanting to do a weekend trip with all of them, and I had no idea this was happening. I only found out when they started posting on our shared private story that I\u2019m still in. I was literally the only one not there.\n\nWhen I distanced myself afterward (short and delayed responses after I understood where I stand in this friendship), Anna called to \u201ccheck in\u201d\u2014something she\u2019s never done before. When I brought up the trip, she claimed it wasn\u2019t intentional exclusion, just that it came together that way, and gave excuses about me being \u201calways busy\u201d and the trip being overwhelming with them number of people coming.\n\nI told her honestly that it felt like they just didn\u2019t want me there\u2014that\u2019s how it comes across when everyone in your friend group goes and doesn\u2019t even tell you. She kept trying to defend it and said they\u2019d \u201cnever intentionally hurt\u201d me. When I asked her to imagine being in my shoes, her response was literally, \u201cI hope you can also understand my position.\u201d I ended the call politely and thanked her for reaching out, but it just felt like excuses.\n\nLater, she followed up with a text that said something like, \u201cThanks for chatting, I value your friendship and I\u2019m glad we could talk through it.\u201d I didn\u2019t respond directly\u2014just gave it a thumbs up. To me, it felt more like damage control than accountability. Especially since she knows exclusion is a sensitive subject for me from a past incident. It feels like she reached out just enough to say she tried, in case anyone asked\u2014but I\u2019m still sitting with the fact that none of them thought to speak up for me.\n\nWhat really stings is not just Anna organizing it\u2014it\u2019s that none of the others pushed for me to be there either. These are supposed to be my bridesmaids.\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out how to move forward. Do I talk to the rest of them? Let it go? Reevaluate this entire friendship? Right now, I\u2019m leaning towards cutting off. I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019d respond if they reached out asking to see me again. I\u2019d love any advice or perspective.",

    "text": "Porn has fucking wrecked the way people see relationships. Straight up. It\u2019s shoved sex into every goddamn corner of human connection where it never fucking belonged. Now everything\u2019s sexualized \u2014 every bond, every glance, every moment that used to be innocent is fair game for someone\u2019s sick fantasy. And it fucking destroys me to see how normalized this shit has become. You go on Reddit or Twitter or whatever, and people are just casually dropping confessions about having sexual thoughts about their own family, their coworkers, students, teachers, neighbors, and their partner\u2019s fucking parents \u2014 like it\u2019s nothing. Like it\u2019s funny or hot or some dark little quirk to share. What the actual fuck? Is nothing off-limits anymore? Is any relationship still sacred?\n\nAnd what\u2019s even more fucked up is how so many people act like it\u2019s no big deal \u2014 like as long as they don\u2019t \u201cact on it,\u201d it\u2019s somehow okay. Fuck that. That\u2019s such a weak-ass excuse. Just having that shit in your head already means something\u2019s broken. It's not just harmless fantasy \u2014 it\u2019s a sign of rot. It shows how deep porn culture has infected people\u2019s minds. They\u2019ve been so desensitized that they genuinely believe they can sexualize anyone around them and it\u2019s totally fine, as long as they keep it to themselves. That\u2019s delusional. That\u2019s dangerous. That\u2019s fucking disgusting.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be real \u2014 this isn\u2019t just about what someone jerks off to. It\u2019s about how they see people. They stop seeing human beings and start seeing body parts. Roles. Fucking categories. Their whole view of relationships gets warped until every person they know becomes just another character in their porn-soaked imagination. That\u2019s not normal. That\u2019s not \u201ckinky\u201d or \u201cdark\u201d or \u201cjust fantasy.\u201d That\u2019s some mentally twisted shit. And it\u2019s everywhere. It\u2019s eating away at people's ability to love, to connect, to respect others like actual fucking humans. People are so deep in this shit they don\u2019t even notice how far gone they are.\n\nAnd no one\u2019s calling it out. No one fucking talks about it because everyone\u2019s either too scared to offend someone or they\u2019re just as far gone. So the sickness keeps spreading. It becomes the default. It gets passed down. Kids grow up in this hypersexualized, boundaryless hellhole and think it\u2019s normal to be turned on by a fucking stepmom or a cousin or a classmate. That\u2019s not edgy, that\u2019s not taboo \u2014 that\u2019s fucked up. It\u2019s cultural rot on a soul-deep level.\n\nAnd honestly, it makes me wonder how many people have had to deal with that gut-wrenching feeling \u2014 when someone close, someone who should\u2019ve been safe, looks at them in that wrong fucking way. Not a stranger. Not some random creep. But someone they knew. Someone who should never have had those kinds of thoughts. That shit fucks with your head. It stays with people. And it\u2019s exactly the kind of quiet, hidden damage this porn-soaked culture creates \u2014 damage no one wants to admit is real because it\u2019s uncomfortable or inconvenient or makes them look in the mirror.",

She tried to manipulate me by saying that I had a bigger one, that I knew how to move, etc., but I told her that I didn't care who was better in that regard. I asked her who knew that she slept with Jos\u00e9, and to my surprise, all our mutual friends knew.\n\n\nI asked her what day she slept with Jos\u00e9. She was a little hesitant, but she said it was the first week, Thursday to be exact. I didn't want to continue with this anymore, but she told me she regretted it while they were doing it, that she loved me, and that it would get better for both of us. At that moment, I interrupted her, saying that if she wanted to improve, she should improve for herself, not for me because I didn't see a future with her. At that moment, she started crying. I told her that when she finished calming down, she could leave. She calmed down a short time later. She tried to kiss me, but I pulled away.\n\n\nI told her I didn't want to hear about her or Jos\u00e9 like that anymore. Now I'm trying to distract myself by doing several things. I'm thinking about signing up for swimming. I decided to focus on my studies. Also, as an extra hobby, I decide to go for walks in the early morning. I feel like things are going to get better.\n\n\nTldr: My ex came to my house and tried to get us back together but I rejected her.",

    "title": "I broke up with my boyfriend because he called my best friend a predator",
    "text": "TL;DR: boyfriend doesn't want to meet my best friend and calls him a predator. Verbal abuse and aggressive behavior towards me. I break up and want to leave, he asks to be roommates because he can't afford rent on his own.  \n  \nI (F24, Italy) and my boyfriend (M25, US) live in Switzerland. He moved to my place last November, because we were having a good relationship and it's a way to save money with the crazy renting cost in this city.\n\nI have a dear best friend from my hometown, we basically grew up together since we are the same age, were neighbors and our parents had a good relation. We went through primary, middle and high school in the same classroom and always hung out together during university. After I moved abroad, we still kept in touch by texting and we saw each other every time I went back to visit my family.\n\n*^(This has nothing to do with the current issue, but I still think it needs to be said: we NEVER had any kind of romantic or sexual feelings for each other; every partner we had always understood this.)*\n\nSo, last month my friend told me he was taking a trip to France with his girlfriend. Since I live in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, we decided that they should definitely stop here for a couple of days on their way back to Italy. I was really happy to see him and his girlfriend again, and my boyfriend was also glad to finally meet this guy.\n\nTwo days ago they left for France, and my boyfriend asked some basic questions to already know them better before meeting. He got curious on how long they've been together, and I said 5 years.  \n\"Oh, so they met in college?\" I said no, she was in high school. He got very cold and asked how old was she. I said 17, why?  \nHe started to freak out. Asking if he ever did anything weird or creepy to me. I got quite upset at that, because this friend is one of the persons I trust the most in the world. Then my boyfriend started raising his voice, yelling that my friend is a predator, a pedophile. I'm like, what? I tried to explain that not only is the age of consent in Italy 14, but it's totally normal to see high school students having a relationship with 18, 19, even pushing to 20 year olds. Of course the majority of relationships happens between students around the same age, but still, it's normal. But he wouldn't have any of it, mumbling stuff like \"these fucking r-word societies\". At that point I got really annoyed and said that we treat teenagers as people capable to have basic responsibilities, make their own choices in order to learn and enjoy life, not as stupid children who need constant protection and repression. When I was 16 I also had a FWB thing with an 18 years old for a few months.\n\nAnyway, he said that he's not going to meet my friend because he feels disgusted. I said that he's a very important person in my life, so I don't want to stay in a relationship in which there's going to be so much tension with my best friend and hostility towards him. He said \"Whatever, I don't fucking care\" and left.  \nI needed a backup plan, so I immediately contacted a friend living in here, because she's going abroad until the end of the year and is looking to sublet; she said that if I confirm, I can already move my stuff in there this weekend and sleep on the couch until she leaves on the 12th.\n\nWhen my (ex) boyfriend came back he kept insulting both my friend and me again and started knocking stuff from the table and the furniture (nothing broke, even though my headphones were some of the things that fell on the floor). At that point I told him that we're done and that I already found another place. I'm obviously paying half the rent for May, since my name is still on the contract. He said I cannot do this to him, that there's no away he can afford paying the rent on his own and that finding a new apartment takes a long time and is a very difficult process (true). So I told him I can stay here (I can afford it), but he needs to move out ASAP, he can find a cheap sublet or a friend's couch for the time it takes him to find another place. He said no, that it would be \"degrading\", so I said that I'm going away, not my problem.\n\nNow he says that I'm overreacting (he's the one that kept yelling and that showed an aggressive behavior), that we can be roommates until he finds a place, promising that he's going to keep his distance and limiting the interactions to a minimum. I'm slightly inclined to trust him, after all it's the first time he acted this aggressively with me. But part of me is saying \"don't risk it\"; plus, I wouldn't be able to hang out with my friend and his girlfriend in a calm place.",

    "text": "I think that a lot of young men like me (20M) browse through these Subreddits. Young men who haven't had sex yet and wish to do so. If that applies to you and you're considering to take a shortcut, please listen to my story. \n\nJust a few hours ago, I was a stuttering mess. I politely declined her advances, let her keep the money, and left peacefully. I did not do the deed, I did not. And looking back at it: it was the right decision. But please let me elaborate. \n\nBefore I booked that appointment and went to the location, I had this feeling that it was \"high-time\" I did this. I wanted to \"be a man\" and imagined myself much happier after the entire endeavor, finally reaching that status that I could flaunt. I figured that other people did it and turned out fine, so why couldn't I do it? Well, those are the thoughts that led to me booking it all. \n\nI even jokingly went to the chapel and prayed, asking that nobody shall catch me and that I can simply get away with it. Currently, a lot of people I know are not in town right now. I deliberately waited until this moment, knowing it'll make things easier. I prepared a route and a time, I really did my homework. \n\nAnd then there I was, thirsty in the room. It was then and there that I looked in the mirror and saw myself: a young man who was about to commit a mistake. In that moment, a phrase came to mind: \"The process is just as important as the result.\" \n\nFrom there, it dawned on me. I didn't want this. I didn't need this. It doesn't define me as a \"a man\". I do not need to do this. I shouldn't. I don't want to face the people I love knowing that I paid for such a thing. How did I ever think I needed to be here to prove anything? It's bullshit. It's not who I am and what I do. It's fine. \n\nSo I ended up drinking some water and asking to leave, as I stuttered a lot. And I ended up doing just that. \n\nAnd you know what? I do not regret it, one bit. I just knew that if I had pulled through, I would have deeply resented myself.\n\nInstead, I went to a restaurant and bought a burger. It was a really tasty burger. It had a familiar taste that brought me back down to earth. And now, I just feel . . . .  a bit bad. I feel bad for ever considering it at all. I don't have to. This is not my way. And adding onto this: I can't tell you when I will get intimate. And that is fine. All I can ask you to read through this story, if you are in a similar place, and listen to me: you are not any less of a man because you haven't had sex yet. You are more than that. Never let anyone or anything pressure you, not even yourself. \n\nRight now, I am just glad to be at home. I am writing this, despite feeling uneasy about the whole thing. I just hope that the Father saw me avert the deed before it was sealed. I just hope that I can take this experience and turn it into a catalyst for self-growth and development. And I hope that whoever is reading this can learn from my mistakes and avert the process entirely. ",

Listening to reggae and Ian Dury. Smoking cigarettes and talking about art. Painting, reading and discussing politics and West Ham. Nowadays I'm not even sure I'd recognize him. It's only in the mirror where I can make out his face.\n\nThe last I heard was that he left the city fifteen years ago. Three years earlier he promised me that he'd meet me at a certain spot at a certain time the day after. I sat there alone for three hours. I was twelve and my mother had just met another man, the man who I now introduce as my father. For three more years he lived here, and then the he left and is nowhere to be found. No online presence, no relatives I can speak with, nothing.\n\nMy whole life I've been chasing my idea of his acceptance. I studied art, books became my primary hobby, my record collection is from what I can remember of him.

Stuff about how he enjoyed hurting girls emotionally. Said he\u2019d do it just to watch their reactions. He was proud of it.\nNow I feel like my whole life has been a lie.

I don\u2019t do it, I don\u2019t like when my partner does it. And he\u2019s liking all these posts obviously, hence it his newsfeed/FYP comprising of 99% of that. Well, last night I saw he had recently \u201cliked\u201d a video of some half naked woman (again) saying \u201crejecting a girl because you have a girlfriend is like rejecting money because you have a job. Real men don\u2019t limit themselves.\u201d I nearly puked. I\u2019ve felt sick ever since. He obviously had no idea I\u2019d ever see any of it. \n\nCall me stupid, but he cheated on his ex wife. It was one of the first things he told me when he met, and I decided to see how things went and whether or not I\u2019m seeing the changes in himself that he swore he had made. I have a cordial relationship with his ex wife who told me she genuinely hopes he truly has changed for my sake and his. I saw enough changes that I decided to give him a chance, but truthfully it\u2019s subconsciously been a fear and insecurity of mine. But everything else seemed and felt so genuine, including him learning from his infidelity. \n\nI feel so hollow. I have had my heart destroyed, and after a lot of therapy and work on myself, I met him and we fell in love and I truly believed he was \u201cit.\u201d \n\nI know what to do. I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m glad I saw it, I really am. But I\u2019m feeling so much hatred and animosity toward him right now. He lied. And I\u2019m just disgusted by him.

    "text": "In 2020, my friend posted an Instagram story saying he\u2019d thought there was a dead human body in his apartment complex\u2019s dumpster, but upon closer inspection, it was just a hyperrealistic life-sized silicone sex doll with no head. \n\nI asked if I could come pick her up. Obviously I had no plans to have sex with the doll, I just felt bad for it. With the help of said friend and my fianc\u00e9 at the time, we loaded her into my other friend\u2019s truck and drove her back to my fianc\u00e9\u2019s and my apartment. I was also an art student at the time, so I made a video art project out of cleaning her (she had clearly been dragged across gravel and was covered in dirt). She was 150 pounds, and I was 130ish pounds at the time and my then-fianc\u00e9 weighed even less, so transporting her up 4 flights of stairs was rough, but we managed. Also I should note I was 21 when this occurred. My fianc\u00e9 was a few years older. \n\nI named her Priscilla and we set her up in our bedroom after putting her in clothes. I wanted to add a head to her, but the female mannequin heads I found were proportionally way too small for her body.\n\nWhen I broke up with my ex, he (very reasonably) demanded that I get rid of Priscilla so he didn\u2019t have to deal with her, and so my older siblings and I wrestled her into a trash bag and threw her out. I had to move back in with my parents post-breakup, and I wasn\u2019t ready to explain to them why I had a life-sized headless silicone sex doll in my luggage.\n\nI am not a superstitious person and I don\u2019t believe inanimate objects have souls or anything, but it kind of broke my heart to throw her into the trash, in the same way it broke my heart to have to throw away stuffed animals when I was a kid. It\u2019s weird. It\u2019s been a couple years since then and I recently saw a tweet from our local police scanner follower that someone thought they saw a body but it was actually a headless sex doll, and I wonder if it was Priscilla. This is so stupid.\n",

M picks out stuff from the shelves, checks out like normal  and then clocks out in the office.\n\nI'm just starting a transaction with a customer when M passes behind me and stops. M runs her hand up and down my back four times, then says \"you smell nice tonight\", before she scratches my several times all while I'm transacting with a customer. \n\nBetween scanning the items while she's scratching and taking payment I put my hands flat on the counter.

This literally broke my heart. I\u2019m 22M and I have her since I was 9 years old. She saved my life. \n\nI had her by my side during my childhood, my teenage years and my early adult life. We grow up together. I don\u2019t have any sibling and I grew up in a really toxic and emotionally abusive and neglectful family. When I was a kid or a teen and I used to come back home feeling upset about something that happened at school, only my dog was there for me to comfort me. Even currently as an adult, when I have personal problems, the first one to be there for me with a cuddle is her. When I broke up with my ex gf and I was devastated, I used to go for walks with her and calm down. When I used to come home after a bad shift at work, she was there to show me that someone can love me no matter what. \n\nHearing from vets that she isn\u2019t going to live longer than two months is the most heartbreaking experience in my life. I don\u2019t think I would be where I am today if I didn\u2019t receive this kind of love from my beloved dog. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to be mentally well if I see her passing away and live my life knowing I won\u2019t be able to cuddle her again. To go for a walk with her. To spoil her with treats and toys. To see her doing silly stuff and laugh. To feel like there is someone that loves me unconditionally, no matter how many mistakes I made. No matter how problematic I am. I can\u2019t imagine a life after I burry her and see her for the last time. The thought of it makes my heart break and my future seem dark and scary. Seeing her being old and weak is the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever witnessed. The past one week after she got diagnosed, I can\u2019t stop crying. I can\u2019t sleep. I can\u2019t focus on my college. I have so many important tasks for college since it\u2019s my last month and I can\u2019t do any of it. My life is falling apart.

I feel as if it's also destroying my life. I go out and see little girls with their present fathers.. and I stare in awe, I wish I had that. Maybe if I did have that, I wouldn't be as messed up as I am now. \n\nDestroying my life how? You may ask. I haven't been in a relationship in about 4 years now. I have had potential partners.. or talking stages you may say. They were all wonderful guys and I feel terrible for making up some BS excuse to not take it further with them. When in reality.. they just weren't old enough.. they weren't mature enough.. I want a man. I have typically only started looking for older men. Men twice my age. Men that wouldn't mind having me as their controversially young girlfriend. Why? Because deep down I feel like they could help with my daddy issues.. it's a very embarrassing thing to admit. Looking for a father figure in a spouse. Looking for some guidance in my life.. some direction, someone to teach me things that only a father figure would be good at. To prevent myself from making any destructive decisions or to avoid being \"taken advantage of\", I just resort to reading books, that have a strong or prominent father figure.. and I just imagine I had that. Or ill listen to different ASMR audios for the same reason. I also never thought I'd be saying this on a forum.. but, I need to tell someone instead of keeping this all in. It's suffocating. I type this with watery eyes, because of how stupid I feel just trying to confess.\n\nSometimes I just need.. dad. I don't know how else to explain it. My father was partially in my life, but he wasn't present. I would only see him on weekends. I was always given a \"hush\" gift. I'd try to make conversation or connect with him and he would just give me short worded answers and give me something to make me leave him alone. I caught on to this in my early teenage years. I am now 24, and the oldest of my 3 other siblings. My father wasn't emotionally present for me.. but for my baby sister who is 3 now, he is extremely active in her life. Him flaunting taking her on occasional \"daddy/daughter dates\" on his facebook.. taking her trick or treating.. \"teaching\" her how to use his different lawn equipment.. And I have actually cried about this. Seeing all these pictures of my father pop up on my facebook timeline, of something I should have had.. but didn't. I shouldn't be jealous, but I am. I am happy for her, and that she's able to experience what I didn't get to.. but I needed that too. This is probably all over the place, but I'm just venting and typing what I feel. \"See a therapist\".. is what Im going to anticipate most people would say. But not everyone can afford it, and Im afraid that therapy just can't fix this. ",

    "text": "Like the title states, my gf (18F) of 2 almost 3 years is leaving for MSU after this summer, I (18M) am sticking in my home town because I can\u2019t afford to leave the state for schooling. I CAN however afford to do one of the more affordable schools or community college within an hour drive of MSU and suggested this, because it\u2019s the healthiest and longest relationship of my life (go figure, I\u2019m only 18). Her reaction to this was very hesitant and said that it wasn\u2019t a good idea. When I asked why, she said that I shouldn\u2019t uproot my life to be with her. I understand that, but she also knows that I date to marry and I wouldn\u2019t have been with her this long had I been just dating around, so she\u2019s BECOME a major part of my life so I\u2019m committed to doing something like that.\n\nFor awhile we had said that we\u2019d be able to do long distance for maybe a year or two to save up some money, then I could transfer over and graduate (I\u2019d have no struggle to transfer, my academics were plenty to get in). And I was stress about long distance, but ready to make it work.\n\nOver the last couple months, she\u2019s been starting more arguments, accidentally told me that she had been hanging out with a girl shed been crushing on (she\u2019s Bi), saying that I\u2019ve been very problematic recently, etc. \n\nLast night I spoke to her about this, and asked if there was something that was bothering her and she got defensive and said that I\u2019m bringing this up to make her feel bad, and to say everything she had done wrong, and that she\u2019s apparently always \nmad at me. \n\nI had been avoiding the college conversation for a long time because it\u2019s a hard one to bring up. But I brought it up, and said that this kind of conflict isn\u2019t healthy for either of us, and that when she goes to MSU, for both of our sake we might want to stop being together. She said we should stay together for at least the summer, and I agreed.\n\nShe got teary eyed, but she started smiling big within the minute (keep in mind this was after three hours of me trying to work through a different argument). She gave me a hug and said she thought so too.\n\nI hated it. It sucked. I would chase this girl to the ends of the earth. I get along with her family so well, and her brother, and she\u2019s shown me ways that I could be treated that no one has ever shown me before.\n\nI am and I was ready to go anywhere on the globe to stay with her. But I know unhealthy habits when I see them, I know it would make it extremely difficult, with years of education ahead of us, I know it probably wouldn\u2019t work. \n\nBut I\u2019m still ready to do that, if she just says the word I\u2019d make it work, I\u2019d make ends meet.\n\nShe got so happy about what I said last night, suddenly all her other arguments she had with me were gone, and she told me \u201cthis doesn\u2019t change anything, it\u2019s Ok\u201d. I gave her a hug and left, that was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever done. \n\nI\u2019m convinced she had known she was going to do this for a long time coming, and that she had mentally checked out months ago because of it, which makes me a little spiteful. If she had told me before, I wouldn\u2019t have let it go on this long, and it would have been easier to process earlier in the relationship. I\u2019m hurt. \n\nAnyway this was kind of me just spilling, so if you got this far, thanks for reading.

    "text": "I\u2019ve been seeing this girl on and off since early March. Things started pretty intense \u2013 we went on multiple dates, spent the night together, cooked, talked for hours, and had a great connection both emotionally and physically. I really liked her.\n\nBut after a few weeks, she told me she wasn\u2019t looking for a relationship and felt that I wanted more than she could offer. She said we were just in different places. We had a long phone call (over an hour) where she said it would only end with one of us getting hurt. After that, we stopped seeing each other, and I tried to move on.\n\nAfter a few weeks of no contact, I eventually sent her a message. She didn\u2019t reply for an entire week \u2013 and I assumed it was over for good. But then she responded, and we ended up seeing each other again. That night led to us sleeping together, and since then, we\u2019ve spent time together again: painting, walking, being intimate, and genuinely having a great vibe.\n\nThe thing is: she\u2019s now very clear that she only wants us to be\u00a0**friends with benefits**\u00a0\u2013 and that she wants the freedom to\u00a0**date other people**. At the same time, she said she wouldn\u2019t be comfortable if\u00a0**I**\u00a0dated someone else. That\u2019s been hard for me to wrap my head around.\n\nIt honestly feels like she might be trying to make me jealous \u2013 or maybe trying to keep emotional distance while still having me around. But I can\u2019t tell if this is a defense mechanism or if she really sees no future between us. I agreed to the FWB setup\u2026 but I did it mostly out of hope \u2013 hoping that if I stayed close, she might eventually come around and feel the same way I do.\n\nIt\u2019s confusing, because sometimes she\u2019ll go long periods without replying to my texts \u2013 yet when she finally does, her messages are sweet, kind, even flirtatious. We\u2019ve also had two long phone calls (over an hour each) \u2013 one when she broke things off initially, and one after the break when she texted me again and I asked her to call me. That call was warm, even a bit intimate.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to play it cool, act like I\u2019m fine with the setup, but the truth is \u2013 I\u2019m not. I can\u2019t keep sleeping with someone I have feelings for while they\u2019re potentially dating other people. It makes me anxious, insecure, and unsure of where I stand.\n\nSo my question is:  \n**What should I do now?**  \nShould I be honest and set a boundary that I can\u2019t continue like this? Or should I just back away and give her space to figure things out? Is there any chance she feels more than she\u2019s letting on \u2013 or am I just fooling myself by hoping?\n\nAny advice would be genuinely appreciated. I'm stuck between wanting to protect myself and not wanting to lose her.",

    "text": "Throw away bc my main has my face and I don\u2019t need anyone I know finding this. \n\nI (36f) moved to the west coast from the east coast 6 years ago to turn my life around and I am currently visiting my hometown and family and friends. I haven\u2019t seen most of them in about 2 years and in these past 2 years I have grown the most emotionally, mentally, spiritually and experiencing all of this has been a roller coaster. \n\nIn recovery they preach to change people, places and things and that\u2019s exactly what I did to become the healthy human I am today. Coming back to these people, places and things as this new person has me full of gratitude and also full of heartbreak. \n\nI have a massive family and we all walk different paths on this earth and some are rougher than others. Witnessing my cousin fail his two children is what got me here tonight. \n\nI understand we all have our own demons and battles. I don\u2019t have children so I will never know what it\u2019s like to be a parent and that being said no child should have to live in filth. I couldn\u2019t even breathe when I walked into that house, I could smell the stench just approaching the house and tried to abort mission but I had no way out. I didn\u2019t breathe for the whole 3 minutes I was inside before I asked to go see the backyard. There are two children (the gf\u2019s kids) under 5 and my cousins girlfriend is pregnant. This can\u2019t be healthy for any of them or the unborn baby. \n\nThe other 2 children are MS and HS aged and the younger one confided in me that she doesn\u2019t want to live there anymore but there\u2019s no where else for her to go and it shattered me. I\u2019ve seen this baby girl grow up and she\u2019s so beautiful, kind and sweet and to see her be neglected, just makes me want to pop off on my cousin but then I would lose access to his children and I want them to know that I will be there for them the best I can. \n\nI\u2019m glad I don\u2019t live here bc then I would be too involved and destroy all the progress I have made on myself bc I might not have kids but I love kids. They just need love, support and attention and they aren\u2019t getting any of that. Ugh my whole heart is just breaking over here. \n\nThank you for reading if you made it this far. Sending love to anyone reading this that is struggling, feels stuck or hopeless. I promise there is a light in that darkness, may it find you \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd",

    "text": "Today I visited the grave of my ex for the first time. He would have been 50 today. He died 5 years ago of a drug related heart attack. I hadn\u2019t seen him for about 10 years before he died. \n\nOur relationship was not great. But he was my first love. I was 16 when we met. He was 24. We got together right after my 18th birthday. We were together for 10 years before I found the courage to leave. \n\nHe was beautiful and sad and so in need of love and also mean and hateful. I know that I would have lived a better life if I\u2019d never met him. But I did. And he was my whole world for a long time. I know that I did the right thing by leaving him. \n\nI hadn\u2019t seen him for a decade when I heard that he had died. He spiraled after I forced him out of my life. The alcohol was always a problem. But the drugs became a more predominant problem. \n\nHe died of a drug related heart attack about 5 years ago. He would have turned 50 today. I thought that visiting his grave would be cathartic in some way. But now I\u2019m just so sad. \n\nThe cemetery didn\u2019t even have a record for him. I found his grave by searching for his mother. And even that wasn\u2019t located where the records showed it. His stone doesn\u2019t have his full name, just his last name. There\u2019s no dates. There\u2019s no epitaph. How sad is that?\n\nIt was really obvious that nobody has been there since the stone was placed. How sad is that?  I think that he was the love of my life. It was bad. It was dark. It was abusive. But it was also really deep. I\u2019ve never had a love like that since. I know that it wasn\u2019t healthy. But it was true. And it makes me so sad that he was so disposable to anyone else, even his family. \n\nI\u2019m so fucking sad for him. Because as flawed as he was, he was doomed from the start. He was set up to fail. His drug addict mother died the same way that he did, in front of him, when he was a teen. And she demanded that he not call 911 until she was dead. So he did what she asked. And she died instead of going to prison. \n\nHe always told me that he was going to die like his mother. And he did. And he\u2019s just this sad footnote now. I don\u2019t even think his family wants to remember him. But he haunts my dreams. \n\nI\u2019m so sad today  \n ",

Got more self confidence in my late 20s, along with doing a lot better financially, and things started getting a lot easier for me.\n\nI met this girl who was super into me from the getgo, and I noticed she would sort of perk up whenever would act in any way mean or rude to her (in a joking way). I remember she'd come over for Netflix and chill and after like 10-15 she'd just hop onto her knees and start blowing me (god i miss that). One time as sort of a test as she was unzipping me I said something dumb like \"yeah you'd better suck it good, or else...\"\n\nAnd her eyes just lit up. She responded \"Or else what?\" in the most hopeful way, and at that moment i figured if I just embraced the dark side I could really get this girl on the hook. But I couldn't do it, not even pretending just once. I would just have so much guilt about it. A few weeks after that she ghosted me and I never saw her again.\n\nI think about that moment a lot, but I don't really have any regrets. I probably spent too much of my life pedestalizing women, but it's who I am at this point.",

So yeah, I went through her stuff and found proof: she was cheating.\n\nIt destroyed me. We have a house. A child. A life we were building. And the worst part? She was always pressing me to prove my loyalty and making me feel like I wasn\u2019t doing enough\u2026 while she was the one being disloyal behind my back.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t just sit with it. I found the other guy\u2019s info. Dug through what I could until I figured out who his girlfriend was. I found her info and told her everything.\n\nShe confronted him. He confessed. And just like that, he messaged my fianc\u00e9e one last time and completely cut ties. She has no idea it was me who blew it up.\n\nFor a while, I was full of rage. Betrayed. Grieving. But knowing she lost him too \u2014 and never knew why \u2014 gave me peace. That was the moment I stopped begging for clarity and started choosing myself.\n\nWe\u2019re separating now. Co-parenting. Untangling years of love, lies, and damage.\n\nOne day, our daughter will ask what happened between her parents. Why we didn\u2019t make it. And I\u2019ll have to explain that the person I trusted most broke that trust.\n\nSo I wrote a song. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s real.

    "title": "I Manipulated You to Hate Me: Truth Hidden for Almost a Decade",
    "text": "If this confession finds its way to you, through any means available, then so too will the truth I've hidden for almost a decade. A truth I\u2019ve carried like a second heartbeat. Perhaps it will be retold through other means, or archived through the internet.\n\nLet me take you back\u2014back to where it all began, when we were just kids wrapped in uniforms and naivety.\n\nWe met in high school, not through fate, but through forced proximity. Assigned seats brought us side by side, and at first, I hated it. You were loud, impulsive, too full of mischief and too quick to speak your mind. You were everything I found chaotic. And yet, I couldn't look away.\n\nI told myself I needed to endure you, to preserve my own peace of mind. So I chose to befriend you. I laughed at your jokes, joined your pranks, and walked beside you after school as we made our way from campus to the city\u2019s crowded transport station. We lived in the same village, so our paths intertwined more than most.\n\nDuring those walks, I began to see past the tomboyish exterior. Beneath that sharp wit and unapologetic energy was someone delicate, someone tender\u2014someone who tucked her vulnerabilities behind a mask. I began to admire the duality of you. And as we messaged more, I found myself drawn in, unsure when the lines between pretend and reality began to blur.\n\nIn our third year, something shifted. A girl entered the picture. She was confident and direct, confessing her feelings to me soon after we met. I didn\u2019t say yes, but I also didn\u2019t say no. I told her I wanted to get to know her first. When she started visiting our classroom to walk me home, I noticed something new in you\u2014jealousy. You disguised it poorly behind sarcasm and snide remarks. But I saw it, and I felt it.\n\nThen she vanished from our lives for a while, just like that. And as if in her absence, you stepped forward. We began our little \u201cact\u201d\u2014pretending to be lovers for fun, or so we said. But the joke wore off quickly. Days turned into months. One day I confessed I had fallen for you. You had fallen too. We were young, not yet 18, so we made promises instead of plans. We promised to wait. I swore I would court you the moment we were of age. I would wait until we graduated college. I truly believed you would become my wife.\n\nBut then came your first hint\u2014you were leaving, moving abroad in a few years. That single revelation cracked the foundation of everything I was building in my heart. I was torn. How could I continue loving you and building a future with you, knowing you\u2019d be gone? That heartbreak drove me to a quiet shift, and without telling you, I began to change my path.\n\nWe entered senior high together, same university, different science specializations. You delved into the medical field, I delved into the computational field. I couldn\u2019t help directly, but I wanted to understand you, so I immersed myself in what you loved. I learned origami, cosplay, debate, programming, even academic research. Every skill I chased, every strength I sharpened\u2014it was all so I could worthy to stand beside you.\n\nYou made me better. And I thought we were unbreakable.\n\nBut senior high and college revealed my growing fears. I wasn\u2019t like the others\u2014tall, wealthy, polished. My insecurities gnawed at me. I feared you\u2019d realize I wasn\u2019t enough. So I did something selfish. I made a plan. One that would make you hate me.\n\nYears ago you gave me a key to your room. You even entrusted me with your baptismal certificate, entrusting me of your future. I returned them after a year, with shaking hands. I told myself it was for your own good.\n\nI had to become someone you\u2019d never love again. I lost my time and attention on you. I buried myself in academics. I accepted leadership roles, joined organizations, all of which to relate to you. I befriended powerful people\u2014children of politicians and business magnates\u2014not out of ambition, but because I wanted to someday follow you to your new home, your new country.\n\nBut that dream of living with you on another country faded due to huge financial constraints, and so my cruel plan remained. I let other girls get close. I entertained their affections. I let you believe I cheated. I let you believe I changed in a bad way. And you started to pull away. Coldly. Quietly. Exactly what I needed, and not at all what I wanted.\n\nThen the pandemic came, so did college. I took every scholarship exam I could. I applied to your university and passed, but my scholarship belonged elsewhere. So I studied in this state university, taking a program I never thought I\u2019d survive\u2014just because it was what you once talked passionately about. I wanted to understand your world, even from a distance. I wanted to fulfill the career you left. I applied scholarship courtesy of alumni of our university that are now living in the states, hoping it will bridge me closer to you, but my calculations shown that it's still better for you to hate me, for your own sake.\n\nYou turned 18, and you told me you didn\u2019t want me anymore. I should have been crushed, but I felt relief. The plan had worked. I had protected you from the heartbreak of distance, poverty, and uncertainty. You were finally free from me.\n\nStill, I couldn\u2019t let go completely. Every so often, I messaged you\u2014not to win you back, but to see if you had moved on. Your cold replies were my reassurance. You had.\n\nThen came the last test. Months before graduation, I asked if I could fulfill the promise\u2014to court you now that I had finished college. You declined. Final closure of my plan and my promises to you. My plan had reached its end. \n\nYou are now a strong, independent woman. You are now living in the country you once mentioned of. You are happy with your complete family. You are now with someone new.\n\nAnd you never knew the truth. You never needed to.\n\nI never cheated, all women around me knew I am loyal to you. I only pretended to cheat on you. I never stopped loving you. Everything I did\u2014from the crafts and skills I learned, the talents I cultivated, the hurtful words I said, the man I became\u2014was because I love you.\n\nThe pattern of 18 you thought that was a coincidence was part of the plan all along. You began to treasure that number, as if you associate it with freedom. It was planned to always be that way.\n\nYou will always be the most profound influence in my life. I\u2019m sorry for everything. I\u2019m sorry I took the villain\u2019s role in your story just to make sure you could become the heroine of your own. I had to make sure you are this unmanipulable, strong, and independent woman. \n\nI let people believe whatever story you tell. You can despise me freely. I accept the blame.\n\nBut know this: you were my greatest love. My greatest heartbreak. My greatest growth. Thank you for loving me.\n\nNow, I have blocked you on all social media, as respect to your current relationship. We are now in our early 20s, I will chase the career we once dreamed about, alone. I\u2019ll build the life I envisioned\u2014with your memory as my compass. I am on my way to happiness, even in your absence.\n\nYou are my greatest treasure, my greatest memory, and my greatest lesson.\n\nIf fate ever brings us together again, perhaps the truth will matter then, and I'll just let fate decide what happens next.\n\nIf not, then in another life\u2014I'd love to papercraft with you again. I hope to walk through the city beside you, laughing, young, and whole, again.\n\nGoodbye, my moon, I am proud of what you have become.

    "text": "I (31F) am extremely unhappy with where I am in life right now. I am the breadwinner and my husband (37M) does not help much with bills or any house work. He\u2019s so forgetful and always saying \u201cI forgot\u201d when it comes to any task. He forgets the recycling, he forgets to take things out of the freezer, he forgets to clean. But never forgets to smoke his weed. I am just becoming extremely resentful. Lately, work has been VERY stressful and I told my husband how I wanted to quit and stay at home for a while with our 1 year old son. Well he says \u201cstay at home, I got us\u201d but he does not have us. He works at a restaurant and brings home maybe $500 a weekend and I work in the tech industry and I bring home $120k. Our monthly bills are $3,000 give or take and he barely contributes. He stays home with our 1 year old but he doesn\u2019t have him on a schedule and he sits him in front of the tv. I am so over this. I need time to think and as soon as I get home I have to make dinner, clean and give my child a bath. If I don\u2019t do these things, my husband will huff and puff until I just can\u2019t take it and I end up doing it anyways. We have been married for 3 months and I\u2019m over it already. He does not have my back financially and I\u2019m not really seeing the point of this marriage. I\u2019m so fed up.  Oh and I don\u2019t even have a ring \u2014 we got married at the courthouse and he couldn\u2019t afford a ring. Everytime I bring it up he\u2019s just like \u201cyou will get one soon\u2014 I\u2019m working on it\u201d I AM OVER IT \n\nTLDR: I (31F) am completely over my husband (37M). I am the breadwinner and stressed at work and he cannot help me. I am starting to resent him. He does not clean or help with dinner. He wastes our son during the day, that\u2019s it. \n",

    "text": "\nI\u2019m not sure how to give the basics of this but I\u2019m 24 going on 25, widowed at 23 and have only really been with that one person. \nAlmost this time last year a friend and I made out while intoxicated (nothing else happened passed that) and we decided to keep things going. [still exclusive] Like I said I\u2019d only been with one person for almost 7 years so I didn\u2019t know where to put my mind for things so I asked around September and they said we\u2019ll keep feelings out of it [they\u2019d had a really shitty year and didn\u2019t want it to be a \u2018in the moment\u2019 thing and hurt me later] and if they are doing too much to tell them and I was fine with that. They\u2019d been very very patient with me in getting comfortable with going further with things too. \n\nCome around to December, close to Christmas (we started hanging out more from September to here) and they get me a VERY nice and thoughtful gift (jewelry). In my mind I\u2019m like \u201cfriends don\u2019t do stuff like this\u201d and of course I\u2019ve extremely thankful I absolutely love it! \nMove on to New Year\u2019s Eve, they give me a kiss (which I honestly did NOT expect, I can\u2019t remember the last time I got a new years kiss) I was on the phone with my mom and still referred to this person as a friend, they were in the car with me at the time. After the call we talk and I give them a hug. They tell me their feelings were a little hurt that I didn\u2019t want my parents to know who they were, explained that wasn\u2019t intentional at all!! They then confess they really like me a lot but scared to hurt me and break my heart. A day or two after really thinking things over I told them I feel the same for them. [[this person had been extremely caring and sweet to me]]\n\nWe spent like almost a full week of not more together in January \nWe were each others valentines too, friends had a big party celebrating birthdays and Valentine\u2019s Day. We talked in the car about a situation that just happened with a friend and about trust. REALLY got into our emotions, we are both still scared we will hurt one another. I told them they have treated me so much nicer than my late spouse and I\u2019m terrified that I will push them away or hurt my own heart \nI\u2019m over there quite often and they have now met my mom and has said meeting other family will happen eventually. I\u2019ve already met their mom as they still live with her, they have a great relationship  (perfectly fine in this economy, do it as long as you can) she talks about me moving in at some point and he has brought it up too(idk if jokingly\u2026my place isn\u2019t the best) there was a convo at one point where they said they\u2019d be damned if they were the reason I wasn\u2019t out there anymore and mom would be upset (this was around October) \n\nWhile I don\u2019t care for a title I guess I\u2019m not 100% sure what\u2019s going on (sorry for the entire lore drop). But I\u2019m terrified that asking will push them away emotionally.  Most everyone who knows says we basically are a thing, I\u2019ve even thought about asking our close friend who we hang out with. They are extremely kind and have put up with my anxiety and depression dips, I do feel guilt still at times knowing I\u2019m being treated so well now. \n\nIdk I\u2019m just really fucking scared, don\u2019t know what to do and I\u2019ve gotten so anxious I\u2019ve thrown up \ud83d\udc80I really think I\u2019m just in my head about things which I\u2019m trying to improve on \n\n*TLDR:* friends with benefits has become more with feelings, there\u2019s no label but things are very much exclusive. We basically act like we\u2019re together in ways. The question of what it is is eating me up, should I ask or leave it be until the year mark comes around? Or let it be period? \n\n**may delete as I think I\u2019m just in my head**\n\n\n",

    "text": "20M - It\u2019s been about two years now. Two whole fucking years of feeling like I\u2019m drifting further away from myself. And lately\u2026 it\u2019s just gotten worse. Like I\u2019m slipping deeper into this fog, and I don\u2019t even know when or why it started anymore. I feel this heaviness in my chest that just won\u2019t go away. Sometimes, I can't breathe properly, and I force myself to take deep breaths like that\u2019ll help. I open windows, I turn the fan on full blast, I pace around the room, hoping the suffocation in my own mind will ease up. It rarely does.\n\nI don\u2019t want to talk to anyone. Not my family, not my friends\u2014no one. I\u2019ve become so emotionally withdrawn that even the idea of a simple conversation feels draining. I was talking to my dad today on a video call, and I could barely hold myself together. I was zoning out, and he asked if I had just woken up. I hadn\u2019t. I just\u2026 didn\u2019t have the energy to talk. I mumbled a few things and ended the call. And it\u2019s not just with him\u2014it\u2019s everyone. Even replying to messages or texts feels like a burden now. I try to push through, I really do, but afterwards I just get hit with this wave of sadness that makes everything worse. It's messed up, right? Like, I actively avoid talking to anyone, but deep down, I feel this desperate need for someone to just get it, for someone to connect with. It's a total contradiction.\n\nI used to love music, movies, games, chess, photography, even nerding out on physics stuff. I poured my heart into building my dream PC once\u2014it was a whole thing for me. But I didn\u2019t abandon it because I moved or got busy. I lost all interest in it long before that. The passion just\u2026 died. And that scares me. Because these were things that used to define me. I don\u2019t even recognize myself anymore.\n\nAnd oddly enough, when I\u2019m around people physically, I can manage. I can keep myself composed. Those emotional waves don\u2019t crash as hard. But the second I\u2019m alone? It all comes back. Tenfold. That heavy chest feeling, the emptiness, the pressure behind my eyes like I\u2019m about to cry without knowing why. But then, once I get through that wave, it feels like\u2026 I don\u2019t know, like nothing happened. Like I was just being dramatic. Honestly, I was all teary when I started writing this post, and now by the end of it, I feel like this is such bullshit.\n\nI\u2019ve never talked about this with anyone before. Not friends, not family, no one. But here I am, typing it to strangers, because what the fuck else can I do? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m suicidal, but the urge to escape is strong. Not to die, just to vanish. To press pause on everything for a while. To not have to pretend I\u2019m okay, or be expected to function, or explain this invisible weight to anyone.\n\nAnd yeah, the idea of therapy crossed my mind. Mostly because that\u2019s what people usually say helps. But honestly? I\u2019m still pretty cynical about it. I\u2019m not sure how talking to someone\u2014someone I\u2019m paying\u2014is really supposed to help me understand something I can\u2019t even put into words. Sure, I could ask my parents to help out, and they probably would without hesitation, even if I didn\u2019t explain everything. But honestly? That conversation feels too heavy for me right now. I just don\u2019t want to open that door\u2014not yet.\nSo yeah. I\u2019m stuck. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m writing this because I don\u2019t know where else to go.",

In spite of the love I felt for her, there's a very deep reservoir of anger intermixed with my grief. I'm angry because she allowed her only child to destroy her reasons for living.",
    "text": "Becky was always a caregiver. When I was little, it was up to her to watch over me while our parents both worked. Back in those days, few parents could afford to pay for childcare.\n\nAs I grew into adulthood, she was always the more responsible one. If I had a financial emergency, she was always there to help bail me out with a check. Later on in life, when I had become the more prosperous one, it was my turn to lend her a hand - which I did gladly. Over time, she became more than my sister - she was my best friend.\n\nShe had her only child, a daughter, relatively late in life. She was 42 when little Nancy was born. By then, I'd had three children of my own.  Almost from the start, it was clear that little Nancy was going to be spoiled rotten. Showered with 100% of her parent's attention and indulged in every way possible, she grew up to be entitled and irresponsible. In her parent's eyes, she could do no wrong.\n\nShe was 18 when she first became addicted to meth. Her addiction led her to cash a stolen, forged check for $500 at her parent's bank. Arrested and charged with a felony by day's end, Nancy's life of addiction related crime was just beginning. She spent the next thirty years in and out of jail and rehab. Moving from meth to heroin and finally Fentanyl. She had a daughter along the way - a daughter virtually raised by my sister because Nancy was too fucked up to deal.\n\nThe entire time, my sister could never bring herself to stop giving Nancy whatever Nancy demanded. Three years ago, as Nancy's father lay dying, my sister gave Nancy permission to move in with them. She needed Nancy's help and support. Nancy brought her boyfriend. At this time, both Nancy and the BF were hardcore Fentanyl addicts.\n\nWhile her dad was in his last days, Nancy and the BF were busily hauling off everything of value they could find and selling it for drug money. They broke into my sister's safe, stole all her cash, maxed out her credit cards to the tune of thirty grand using her stolen ID and emptied her savings account of $30,000. By the time my sister realized what had happened? Her husband was dead, and she was out $60,000.\n\nSo, why am I angry? I'm angry because she indulged her entitled daughter her entire life instead of saying no. I'm angry because she refused to turn her daughter in for the crimes she'd committed against her. I'm angry because I could never share my true feelings with her for fear of destroying our relationship.\n\nBecky told me that she was afraid that if her daughter was arrested, that she (Becky) would lose custody of her only granddaughter. The two junkies were allowed to continue living with her and preying on her - eating her food and taking her car without her permission. It took two more years and even worse carnage, and the loss of the granddaughter who was no longer in her custody,  before Nancy was finally forced to move out.\n\nThree years later? My sister wanted more than anything to die and be done with her life. I knew before she fell and broke her hip that her depression had reached the point that dying was the one thing she craved above all else. Two weeks ago, she got her wish. My wish for her, as the brother who loved her during her entire life, is that she refused to allow her daughter's addictions to destroy her own life. If she'd managed that? She might still be alive.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

My husband and my kid were there as well. So u was doing cleaning, i was vacuuming the floor and honestly it was dirty. \n\nAfter i was done I mopped the floor, my in law\u2019s have comments about this being dirty or whatever even when i didnt even start the electric mop. I was already irked because it was not her only comment since i started cleaning. It felt like she thinks i dont know what i am doing. So anyway fast forward i was finally down to the last room and it\u2019s her bedroom. \n\nFloor was dirty and her room has a door leading outside so she was sitting there outside next to her room window with my daughter and my husband pulling weeds. She said that it\u2019s enough because it\u2019s already clean. Now I don\u2019t really like cleaning especially after having such a busy day, worked as kitchen help. (Story for another day) when i clean i make sure it\u2019s clean, not clean-clean but proper clean. \n\nMy head is always all or nothing. I dont know why but this us how im wired. So i stopped mopping. The way i do it is vacuum-mop-let it dry-vacuum because after mopping there tends to be dirt left, just to make sure that it\u2019s thoroughly clean. I appreciate tht after cleaning we are going out to eat, so in my mind okay\u2026 but then in law said we are gonna take a half an hour walk and no one is staying in the car. I am tired from work yesterday and I cleaned at her house and now apparently i am obliged to go walk with them, now my husband knows I don\u2019t even like walking, it\u2019s hot outside, humid and sticky. \n\nSo i said i am staying in the car and will just relax, my in law proceeded to say no one stays in the car everyone will go out and walk\u2014- like excuse me i am 29 years old and i can decide if i want to or not. She then said but look at the view it\u2019s wonderful blah blah and i still said the same thing. \nI came from a third world country and a very poor one at that so i think in her head i am very ignorant with a lot of things that are normal to her. \nBut i did know things and i had a decent job before i got married. \nAnyway now i feel like i soured the mood for dinner. I don\u2019t feel okay now and just wants to go home but i need to stay because husband and kid is here waiting for food. \nRight now i dont even know what i am typing i feel that like it\u2019s all over the place.

    "text": "I am a doctor who takes care of cancer patients. A lot of my patients either already have or turn to religion after their cancer diagnosis - they approach death largely (in my experience) in two different ways: the first say \u201cI am going to be with God now- I have fought this cancer hard but\u00a0 I have lived a good life and this is God\u2019s will.\u201d\u00a0 These patients die peacefully- surrounded by family and friends on their own terms.\u00a0\n\nThe others: \u201cGod will give me a miracle.\u201d They will be actively dying in a hospital bed, and any intervention would be futile \u2014 and I mean ANY.. they are on death\u2019s door- I have spent HOURS preparing them for this moment, we have exhausted EVERY avenue,.. but still they say \u201cGod will find a way, God will give me a miracle.\u201d\u00a0They leave this world kicking and screaming- traumatizing their family and the people around them, leaving behind a long trail of devastation, medical bills and financial confusion because they didn't think about getting their affairs in order in advance (even when being told to). \n\nLast week I had a patient and his family who had a stage IV cancer.  Halfway through his initial treatment he decided to stop for no reason, and didn\u2019t come back. Six months later he came back with widely metastatic disease, weak, unable to eat, expecting a miracle from God. Well- if God exists- then God gave you that miracle in the form of upfront cancer treatment that could have significantly prolonged your life- even with a stage IV diagnosis.\u00a0 And you ignored the call. In fact, the whole family did, and now are blaming the medical system for not being able to treat him because he is just too sick.\u00a0\n\nLess than 100 years ago there was NO treatment for the disease you have, and now we have many lines of therapy that can prolong your life\u2026 but no.. that is not miracle enough. Somehow God giving us the science to understand cancer and help treat it for many people is just not miracle enough. God needs to give you your own miracle to treat only your cancer because for some reason you deserve that attention? No.. absolutely not. What makes you so deserving? Have you live an exemplary life in the service of others? Have you performed miracles for others?\u00a0 Did you follow the exact teachings of the Bible (if that is your book of choice)? By what moral code did you live so perfectly that you now expect God to focus a miracle on you? Have you helped many hundreds of people? Have you helped even a few? I do not know. It does not matter. A miracle was offered to you\u2026 and you blew it.\u00a0\n\nThere is only one group of people in my mind that truly deserve miracles- innocent children. . The rest of us? We live in too much sin.\u00a0",

    "title": "I found out, via an Instagram post, that my maternal grandmother died. No one in my family has reached out to me to let me know. It's been 2 weeks.",
    "text": "To be fair, I'm (32m) estranged from most of my family, but I do still talk to my older sister (35f) and younger brother (29m). Albeit in a limited capacity, but we text often enough.\n\nI haven't spoken to my parents in almost 5 years. Our relationship has been... rough for the last 14 years. That's how long my wife (33f) and I have been together. I fought with my parents quite a bit early in me and my wife's relationship because my wife is black and my parents didn't like that too much. They cussed me out, cussed her out, called her every racial slur they could and eventually kicked me out of the house for standing up against them. \n\nThis caused my wife and I to move in together pretty quickly which led to us getting married very young. But honestly, I wouldn't change anything but the trauma we went through. My wife is my best friend and I don't know what I'd do without her and I'm confident she feels the same way. Later this year we will be celebrating our 14th wedding anniversary.\n\nFor the first few years after my wife and I moved in together, late 2011 to mid 2013, I didn't speak with my parents. It wasn't until my wife got pregnant in 2013 that we decided to let them know that they were going to be grandparents for the first time. We invited them to the baby shower, but my mom blew us off because she was attending the baby shower for one of her friends instead. We invited them to the hospital when my son was born. I remember them saying they were on the way, they only lived 20-30 minutes from the hospital. My FIL got there faster and he had a 6-hour drive, same with my MIL but in the opposite direction.\n\nWe tried to make a relationship with my parents work. We tried to attend family gatherings and dinners and holidays. But every interaction left a bad taste in our mouths and eventually we would just make excuses for why we couldn't go. \n\nAs our son got older, he was diagnosed with level 2 ASD at age 4 or 5. At this point he was completely non-verbal and only just getting the hang of using the toilet with quite a bit of assistance. Our son became the excuse to dip out early or to avoid events entirely. We didn't always lie to get out of stuff, but between the bad vibes involved with going to my parents' house and my son's unpredictable meltdowns, we'd rather just stay home most days. Why mess with our peace and my son's comfort? \n\nFast forward to the summer of 2020. Black Lives Matter protests are in full swing. My wife and I are in it. Attending protests, sharing information about how to be safe during protests and also arguing with people on the internet and sharing things related on social media. My mom decided that this would be a great time to say some racist things about the movement and then say that racism doesn't exist in the same breath. \n\nWhen we confronted her about it, bringing up the history we've had with her racism, she conveniently has a selective memory, says she doesn't remember saying any of the things she said to me or my wife. My dad defended her, my aunt (her sister) defended her, my younger sister (26f) defended her and even my former best friend who I considered an adopted brother defended her. I blocked all of them on Facebook, which is where most of this arguing took place, and I blocked their numbers. I deleted Facebook shortly after this as well.\n\nI blocked everyone in my family initially and only recently started talking with my older sister and younger brother within the last few years. So far, they have respected my wishes to not be involved with my parents or younger sister.\n\nI grew up most of my childhood at my paternal grandmother's house and was always around my dad's side of the family. Today, I still speak with my paternal grandma and my dad's sister. After my other grandma passed, I've been hesitant to call anyone but I'm compelled to call the one grandma I have left. \n\nI never really had a real relationship with my maternal grandmother. According to my mom, she didn't always get along with her. That, combined with her living in a different part of the country, didn't cultivate a strong foundation for a relationship. I could have tried harder to build a relationship but I didn't and now it's too late.\n\nMost of my memories as they relate to my grandma are negative because of what my mom has said about her. But as a kid, the few times I did meet her (could probably count on one hand the actual times I've seen her in my life), it was positive! She always sent me music related gifts for Christmas or my birthday. I'm a huge fan of rap music too this day and my grandma bought me my first ever rap album, BowWow's \"Unleashed\". I know, I know, gimme a break, I was 12. She also gave me my first radio to play my CDs on, which I still had when my wife and I moved in together. \n\nBut even these memories are sullied by my mom. The year I got that BowWow CD, we had actually went to grandma's house for Christmas, drove from LA to Missouri. As soon as we got back home, my mom took the CD and cracked it in half. \n\nI started using Instagram a few years ago to help promote a small business I started in 2023. When I downloaded the app, it had most of my Facebook friends already on there. To my surprise, this included people I had blocked on Facebook. As soon as I realized this, I blocked my parents and my sister. Didn't really care to block anyone else at the time, didn't seem worth the effort. What this meant was that I would still see posts from people like my mom's sister, I just wouldn't interact with them and just kinda lurk. Still, I don't use the app much these days. The business has always been a side hustle and I don't rely on it or push it nearly as much as I used to. \n\nI opened up Instagram a week or so ago to scroll out of boredom. The first thing I see is a post from my aunt. It was a recent photo of my grandma. She looked the same as I remembered her, but her hair was long and flowing to her shoulders. As a kid, when I had seen her, she always kept it very very short. It looked pretty. I don't open Instagram often, so this post was almost a week old. In the body of the post my aunt explains that her mom has passed after a battle with cancer, which they only found out about less than a month prior. \n\nI froze. I felt numb and in a way I still do. Maybe it's the lack of a relationship I had with her, or maybe it's the way I found out, or maybe it's anger at my mom for everything. It's probably all of it.\n\nI know that it's unfair to expect my brother or my sister to bear the responsibility of telling me when someone dies, but given the circumstances it is their responsibility. If the shoe was on the other foot, I know in my heart that I would have told them. \n\nSo yes, I blame them for not telling me. I blame my parents for being such shitty people that I can't have a normal relationship with them. If I had, then maybe I would have developed a relationship with my grandma. I'm angry at everyone and I don't know what to do. \n\nI tried to look up my grandma's obituary or funeral information but haven't come up with anything. She's been married and remarried a few times, and with how everything has been, I don't even know what her last name is anymore. I had 3 possible last names, but they all turned up nothing. I'm not even sure she lives in the same city I knew her to live in 20 years ago. She wasn't on social media at all. I'm heartbroken that this person that I didn't know, never had a chance to know, is gone and I can't even pay my respects without the possibility of facing people that I want nothing to do with. I'm afraid that they will make this about them if I reach out. That they will blame me for isolating myself for the last 5 years. I feel like a fucking teenager all over again and that's pissing me off too.\n\nI think I'm gonna call my other grandma. I know she doesn't have ties with my mom's family, she probably knows about my other grandma but I don't want this feeling of regret tied to her when she eventually goes. \n\nBefore I go, I want to address something before anyone else does. I recognize the irony that I'm angry with my mother for instilling a negative view of her mother onto me in my childhood. My mom is entitled to feel however she has felt about her mom, and I'm entitled to feel how I feel about mine.  Call it generational trauma, idgaf, I know damn well that I'm doing a better job at raising my child than my parents ever could and that's good enough for me.",

I had my first kiss at 14 ( or 9 if that actually counts playing house as a kid) and I had my first boyfriend freshman year too. But I wasn\u2019t allowed to date so it was all sneaking around in the hallway and detention after school. During covid which was 15-17 pretty much I didn\u2019t date at all and had like two friends. All the \u201cdating\u201d I did was online. So no dates, no parties, no drinking, no sex nothing\n\nI didn\u2019t go on my first date until senior year and then I met my now boyfriend of 2 years after on SNAPCHAT. I wanted to lose my virginity to another virgin and we didn\u2019t date until 5 months after we met so I was 18. I was upset he lost his vcard a few months before we met (at 17 so jealous of that) and we dated for like a year and a half before I lost my vcard right before I turned 20 once I gave up on my pipe dream. I love him and trust him so I figured I\u2019m ahead of most people when it comes to losing their virginity and finally did at 19. I also started drinking at 19 which is still technically illegal and a teen but it\u2019s still not a traditional teen drinking thing as I was legal in most countries AND my parents let me drink with them or on vacation at 18 so I had tried champagne and a pina colada already. They don\u2019t know I drink with my boyfriend or at the one party I\u2019ve been to this past year but it just feels so late. I wish I had more rebellious, cool teen years to look back on. ",

I tried my best to give her a wonderful life. The rescue group I adopted her from said they found her on the street. The moment I saw her picture on their website I knew she was coming home with me. It took her several weeks to warm up to me. For the first few weeks she would stay under the dining room table. I was starting to think I made a mistake because she wasn't coming out of her shell--not even a little bit. One night I was sitting out on the porch and I left the door open in case she wanted to come outside with me and she finally did.\n\nOne of my favorite memories was when I took her on a camping trip--it was more like glamping LOL. One of our friends had a camping spot along a river about 4 hours away from us. My friend's brother had a camper so we had a fan for our tent. We went hiking and floated the river on inner tubes. We had a blast.\n\nAnother time I had cut our yard and accidentally left the gate open. Normally she waits on the porch to come inside. After about 30 minutes, I noticed she wasn't waiting so I went looking for her. Y'all!!! I walked around the yard and found her waiting at the other door LOLOL.\n\nLast year during her annual vet visit, they advised me that \"comfort care\" would be on the horizon. We started Mary on low dose pain medicine for her arthritis.\n\nDuring this years annual visit, the vet said that she had lost some weight and wanted to X-Ray her and do bloodwork to see if something else was going on inside to cause the weight loss. Well, it turns out she has a big mass that is more than likely cancerous, her liver is failing, she is anemic, fluid is starting to build up around her heart, she has a 4/6 heart murmur, and her arthritis is pretty advanced. The doctor advised that I could take her to an out of town vet for an ultrasound and surgery on the mass but at 15 it's risky, plus with her other ailments--well I could extend her life but the quality of her life wouldn't be the best.\n\nOf course, I was a mess. I asked the doctor if I would be terrible if I took the rainbow bridge route as opposed to extending her life. She and the techs were so kind and understanding. I've been knowing this was coming but man it still hurts so bad. I'm cooking us some steak this weekend with extra butter and got her a cheeseburger with fries yesterday. I'm so sad y'all, I don't want to do this but I know it is the right thing to do. If you made it this far, thank you for reading <3.",

    "title": "Raped by slightly older girl when I was a kid",
    "text": "So when I (19M) was 8 I was raped by a girl a little older than me. Here is the longer story. When I was in 2nd grade there was a girl I liked, but I didn't want to fumble it, so I thought \"let me try with another girl first and then try with her after\". So I told the girl who sat behind me, who didn't have many friends (I think she was 9 or 10), that I liked her (which was a lie) and if she wanted to \"go out\" or something. She said yes, I was quite popular in the class, so I did also expect her too. Anyways, a couple of days later we were at my house and in my room. She was like \"let's try something\" and I thought \"okay well she knows about relationships, so sure\". She and I then kissed, but not like a peck, no no no. It was french kissing with tongue. I will also clarify that I had 0 idea on what was actually happening as I was too young to know porn or stuff like that - I am guessing she wasn't. Anyways, after a while doing that, she then had me lay on my couch - again I am just following along and thinking that this is what you do. After I lay on the couch she grabs a blanket and throws it over my bottom half and asks me to take my pants off. Again I follow along. She then goes under the blanket and begins stroking my dick before giving me a bj. I was a bit weirded out by this and it did also feel wrong, but alas I let her continue. Don't remember what happened after this, but fast forward a couple of days and we are in my bedroom again. This time she says \"let's try something else\". She then jumps on my couch and pulls her pants down and tells me to do the same. I again follow along thinking that this is just what you do in a relationship. She then tells me to put my dick inside of her. All I can remember is that I try to do it in her ass, because I ain't even know that women had another hole at this point. Anyways, the next thing I can remember is me asking her if I should go down on her, since she did it to me (not exact wording of course). She says okay and pulls her pants down again (same day I think, but not 100% sure). I remember that there was a dust bunny (I think that is what it is called - english is not my first language) on her vagina and that put me off from doing it. Next I remember us being in her room and all we did there was kiss, this time just regular kisses. The last thing I remember is her showing me what porn was - which is actually where my addiction to that and masterbation started. Also I hadn't actually hit puberty at this point I don't think, so like my dick couldn't even get hard and I didn't actually have any \"extra\" feeling in it yet, from what I remember at least. Anyways, just wanted to write this down and sent it out to the world to tell someone I guess. Will also just say that I think these events have traumatised me a bit and I am actually really scared for when I am going to be with a girl. If anyones as any tips on how to actually deal with this I would greatly appreciate this. No one knows of this story, not my friends, my parents, no one.\n\nEdit: the reason I have told no one is because I am very embarrassed by all of this. I think because I feel that it is my ow fault, you know because I did ask her without really wanting to be with her",

He didn't even seem fazed by what we were talking about. He said he had no secrets to hide from me and even joked that if there was anything, then he knew I would find it eventually. Nothing about how he was acting or talking seemed like he'd been caught or did anything wrong. \n\nI am choosing to stay with him even after finding this because I love him, I just don't know how to confront him about it. I want to find a way to talk to him about it without seeming hostile or too strong about it, as I just want to get the truth out of him. I've spoken to some friends and they say I'm making the wrong choice, which I may be, but it's what I want to do. I just need some unbiased opinions on the matter and some help on how to start the conversation. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read ",

    "text": "Hi so I (18M) and my gf (18F) are really happy together, she\u2019s the most amazing person I have ever met. However, she gets very cut off whenever she\u2019s under extreme stress and she is at the moment. This is just the way she is and I can sometimes get lonely when she goes into this mode, she tries her best to make an effort and stuff but I still sometimes feel a bit alone. I don\u2019t really have any friends outside of her so I end up keeping to myself until she is able to reply. But recently I\u2019ve been just scrolling on instagram and stuff and come across one of her long term friends and I go in their page. Seeing photos of my girlfriend super happy and out with her friends it just makes me super sad because she\u2019s not feeling good at the moment, I also don\u2019t know if it\u2019s me being a bit jealous at the fact that she isn\u2019t like that whenever we are hanging out at the moment?? I just want her to feel okay, she puts in so much work but she never feels it\u2019s enough?! I hate seeing her upset like this. Sorry if this didn\u2019t fully make sense, I kinda just yapped but long story short. My girlfriend is really stressed, sad and distant at the moment, she\u2019s super autistic and it\u2019s how she functions. It\u2019s left me feeling sad and a little alone.\n\nThanks if you read all of this :) ",

    "title": "Tired, so tired",
    "text": "Hi all, I hope you are hanging in there. I'm sure several if not the majority of people can relate to this on some level.\n\nI'm so freaking tired. So overwhelmed. All the time. Always playing catch up on things to get done, always behind, always not able to get enough done. Life goes so fast and like everyone I just need a break. There's always something going on, even on the good days. Even when I would consider I'm having a good day, if I think about it, I feel like total shit and like I can't keep up. On bad days I'm drowning in things I can't get done and things I never have time for that I want to do but never feel good enough to do. I'm tired of being sick, tired of being tired, and tired of never having any time where I don't feel this way. \n\nI'm in graduate school, been trying to get through it, but I have several chronic health conditions that keep getting in the way. My autoimmune diseases seem like they are always flaring at the most inconvenient times, even my nuisance conditions that shouldn't cause problems too severe are making it hard to get done daily tasks like simply standing some days. I'm struggling on how to navigate professional life, and life in general when I'm always so fucking exhausted and everything is always going nonstop. Should probably add that I have ADHD too. So the brain fog is wild sometimes. Like if I could just function at even part of what I should be able to, if if my brain and body would cooperate even 10% more, I feel like it would be life changing. \n\nI've always been an optimist and a people pleaser and never really realize how awful I feel unless I let myself think about it. I go and go and then suddenly the world is falling apart because I pushed too hard and can't keep up. I've gotten better at that somewhat, but I realized today that part of the problem I think is that I never really tell people how I truly feel. I've spent at least half of my life telling people I'm doing okay when they ask, even when I'm not (unless it's at a doctors office). I've gotten to the point where I now say \"I'm hanging in\" or \"I'm here\" rather than saying I'm okay, but in reality, I need to tell someone that I'm not fucking okay. Not at all. \n\nDon't worry, mental health wise I'm actually okay. There is no risk I'm going to do anything dangerous, or stupid, or anything concerning. I just need to be honest with someone about how I feel without worrying how they will take it, if I'm unloading too much, or if its going to stress them out. \n\nPeople often ask how you are to be polite. It's a social convention, but most of the time, people don't really want to hear how you're doing. Then to make it worse, the ones who do want to hear how you are actually doing are the people who you don't want to upset and worry. The people you love and who care about you are the ones you try to put on a brave face for, and the strangers and acquaintances who don't care likely won't take well to you having a breakdown on them. Then there's the people you open up to, the ones who you thought can handle it, but sometimes it's too much for them and they pull away and that support is gone. You don't want to be too much, you don't want to be the person who complains about their life or how they feel, you don't want to overwhelm others or make them worry... so you say you're okay. You say you're hanging in there. When really you want to break down in tears and let yourself have the existential crisis that has been pushing on the back of your mind for months or years. \n\nI have a psychiatrist and psychologist. I adore them both. The psychiatrist can't do anything to help because I'm too scared to change my medication to see if it helps my brain work better as I don't want to loose how well my current meds work. My psychologist is the absolute sweetest and I've been with her for so long that now I worry about causing her stress (I know burnout in psych is a big thing, and I'm sure it must be difficult not to take work home with you). Plus, each of our appointments is just me updating her on the latest craziness and chaos, we never even get to do much therapy, it's 75-90% here's what has happened since our last visit. This realization I had is definitely something I'm going to bring up with her next visit though.\n\nThankfully I have my significant other who is there for me when I have meltdowns, and my parents and brother sometimes too. I just don't want to worry them. Especially when I know they already worry so much...\n\nI also feel like things could be so much worse, so it's really not that bad. I'll be struggling but think \"oh, this isn't as bad as that one time you...\". It can be hard to properly explain to people how awful you feel when you still feel so much better than you've felt previously. When you feel like you've been hit by a truck and have the flu, and every time you move you're muscles it burns like you've worked out for days, but at least you're not having to go to the ER, so you're doing better you guess. Like if people ask how you are in that context, what are you supposed to say? I'm doing better but I still feel like death warmed over? That's not a socially acceptable answer, and people won't know how to respond to that, and it will be awkward. So you say you're hanging in, better than you were, or you're managing. But that's not the full truth, and most people don't want to hear it or don't handle hearing it well.  \n\nI feel like if I told people about how I'm truly feeling though it would help with self awareness. I have difficulty knowing when I'm pushing it too hard, and when to ask for help. I'm starting to think it's because I've spent so long putting on a mask for other people that I forget to take it off and check in with myself. I don't know how to know when it's okay to be honest with people though, or who can handle it. I need to start journaling or something, but my ADHD brain never gets me past the first like two or three days. Plus I'm too exhausted and that would be one more thing on my list that adds the the weight. Maybe I just need to periodically come on Reddit and let the world know I'm a mess to get it off my chest \ud83d\ude05. \n\nAnyway, who else is fucking exhausted and overwhelmed and feels like it never ends?",

She managed to catch me heading to my dorm room (next door neighbors) and gave a half-ass apology and of course, was crying during the whole ordeal. She even said she\u2019d get her bf to apologize, he never did.\n\nI thought I was being the bigger person but \u201caccepting\u201d the apology and simply just be an arms-distance from her in terms of friendship.\n\nFast forward to today, ANOTHER incident in my friend group led to her trying to state I was wrong in this situation.\n\nTL:DR I told a roommate of racist friend to leave a birthday party for my roommate (in a respectful way of course).

    "title": "I [21F] am in an unhealthy friendship with my [20F] friend",
    "text": "TW: severe mental health problems, depression, brief mentions of suicidal ideation and attempts. \n\nThis story is quite vague because people I know have Reddit. I also ask that if any YouTube channel sees this, please do not read it to your audience. \n\nSo I met this girl named Shayla when we were both in high school. We bonded over a shared interest in a pretty niche anime.\n\nBefore I start this post, I need to make you understand why I am friends with Shayla. She is funny, she listens to my petty drama and stupid issues, and when we met, we had shared hobbies. She is a sweet girl. \n\nThere is some other, harder to talk about context needed as well. It became pretty apparently early on in our friendship that due to terrible, abusive parents and other factors outside of her control, that Shayla is deeply depressed and suicidal. \n\nNow, for what I meant by unhealthy:\n\nWithin a few months of being friends, she started texting me at odd times of the day some really horrible things regarding her mental state. I, at the time, would spend basically one night a week talking her down from the edge. I know now that this is unhealthy for my mental health and should not be my responsibility. Even then I knew that, but I was afraid of what would happen if I didn\u2019t do it. I used to be afraid that if I didn\u2019t answer my phone in the night that I would wake up the next morning and find out that she is dead. \n\nI won\u2019t go into much detail on this one, but the messages stopped about a year into our friendship. There was an incident that involved Shayla and the police that ended in my friend in the hospital and me sobbing hysterically in the hallway of my apartment building. After the incident, the depressive spirals to me over message stopped. She said that she felt remorseful for how she handled things and promised me that she would stop putting so much on me. I believed her and we moved on. \n\nAgain, I won\u2019t go into much detail, to protect our privacy, but things have gotten better and so much worse for Shayla since then. Her behavior has changed to reflect that. Over the last few years, either due to the depression or her family, she hasn\u2019t done much to help her mental health. She is not employed, she is not in college, she has a therapist, but she doesn\u2019t trust her. Beyond that, she shows little effort towards doing something about this. \n\nShayla has started texting me in the middle of the night again, but this time it\u2019s different. I\u2019m becoming apathetic in a way that scares me. \nI found an article about empathy sickness not too long ago and I almost cried because it sounded so much like what I have become. I don\u2019t want to be numb, but at this point I\u2019m a little scared of what will happen to me if I\u2019m not. \n\nAlso, maybe because of that apathy, I\u2019m starting to realize other things about our friendship. I\u2019ve also started to notice some behaviors when we are together that are very manipulative. \n\n1. She often uses threats of bad behavior to get her way. Usually it\u2019s small, childish behavior, but sometimes it\u2019s something bigger and related to her mental health. Think threatening not going to her therapy appointment if I don\u2019t text her later. \n2. She uses guilt trips. Sometimes she will bring up her suicide attempts as a way to get me to tell her things or do something she wants.\n3. She love bombs me. She has told me repeatedly that I am the reason she is still alive. Her family has also pulled this one on me. \n4. She uses her previously ended friendships and trust issues against me. This goes with the love bombing in a way. She talks about how I am the only one she trusts won\u2019t leave her. \n5. She expects me to take care of her in some ways. When we go out, there is an expectation that I am the one paying for things. She treats me like a surrogate mom in other ways. She once fully said \u201cyou know you\u2019re basically my mom,\u201d before I shut her down on that. \n6. Her abusive family members are starting to expect me to save her. They see me as a good influence. Her mom has called me to try to convince her of things before. Her dad tries to get me to side with him on an arguments. \n7. She hasn\u2019t learned. She says she\u2019ll stop but she\u2019s begun to tell me things that she really should tell her therapist and not me again. I can\u2019t help her. There is nothing I can do and it all leaves me feeling helpless because I want her to feel better but there is nothing I can do. \n8. I don\u2019t see a good end to this. She isn\u2019t seeking proper help anymore. I don\u2019t know what I can do. \n\nSo I\u2019ve realize that this isn\u2019t healthy. I know that this is not good for my mental health, but now I don\u2019t know what to do. The thing is, she has shown potential to change and it leaves me conflicted. I once brought up one of these issues to her and she has made progress towards stopping the behavior after some argument over it. But the thing is that she sometimes tries to weasel through loopholes to get around it and I am scared that this will be like the messages and that if I don\u2019t strictly enforce it, the behavior will come back. \nOn top of that, I fully and truly believe (not because Shayla has told me this) that if I leave her she will try to kill herself again. I don\u2019t know if she will stop if I point out her behavior. She\u2019s not doing this on purpose, but also even if we get into a small argument she sulks and ends our friendship over text and then comes back not long after. I don\u2019t want to suffer in silence anymore but I don\u2019t know what to do. I just wish that I could make her happy. ",

    "title": "My best friend hates because of Tinder",
    "text": "Am I in the wrong?\n\nI've known my best friend for around 10 years, we met when we were a part of a dance studio. We've traveled together and we talk to each other everyday. I love her and she is my only girl friend. \n\nOver a year ago she got out of a 4 year relationship, I supported her from the get-go. The middle of last year she started using dating apps and started talking to men. She would confide in me and I would give her advice, literally always on her side. My best friend started dating this guy about 3 months ago after talking for around 2 months. She told me he would be moving away in October but she was okay with the idea of long-distance as she's working in healthcare and will be in nursing school. I've never met the boyfriend, I've only ever spoken a few sentences to him while she was on the phone with me. The boyfriend just took her on an out-of-state road trip vacation with his group of friends, I was happy for her. \n\nA part of the boyfriend's friend group is a high school bully of mine. I told my best friend about it and she kind of remembered some of my experiences, I told her not to mention me at all during her trip. My anxiety and paranoia was getting the best of me while she was on her trip, I pictured her having the time of her life with someone that made me feel miserable and invalidated my experiences. \n\nWhen my best friend got back, she made jokes about being friends with my bully and while she was showing me pictures of the trip there were so many of just my best friend and my high school bully. From then, I was somewhat upset with her, I tried not to show it. I know I can't be angry with her because she can be friends with whoever the hell she wants BUT it still hurts. \n\nAbout 4 days after her trip she tried to call me at work, I started texting her and she told me that they broke up. I said he was a douchebag for doing that. She responded by saying that it wasn't like that, I told her I'm at work and I don't really know what else to say, he was a douchebag for that. Later that night I texted her saying I was there for her. She never responded. 2 days go by and I texted her saying I wanted to talk about whatever is going on, she proceeded to send me 2 long texts saying that she doesn't want to talk and I'm insensitive, I'm not there for her, and I'm not being genuine. This really hurt, I texted her saying I don't want to text about it, I'd rather call. A week later she actually decided to answer my call and we talked on the phone, she was being extremely defensive for the first half of the call. I apologized to her and told her I know I didn't say the right thing. We started bickering a little bit until my boyfriend interjected and mediated it. The call ended by her saying that she will reach out and tell me what happened when she's ready, she told me that she is not ignoring me to hurt me.\n\nAt this point, she is. It's been a month. I have periodically texted her and have been trying checking in with her, she has been radio silent. She has been posting on Instagram with other friends and is actively on her phone. \n\nShe has never done this to me before, we've never really been in a fight. I'm 22 and I'm getting to the point where I don't want to play a cat-and-mouse childish game of ignoring each other. I'm really hurt by her and everyday I'm waiting for her to reply. I'm going through a weird stage of grief where I want to slap her but I also miss spending time with her. I'm not sure if I'm willing to be her friend anymore after this and I can't stop thinking about, it's basically killing me at this point.\n\nOnce again, am I in the wrong?",

They're not things he ever intends to follow through on, but that doesn't make them any less serious. He's already been involved with the police and courts. He has had no-contact orders (and has violated them), has been on probation, and has spent time in lockup. He's managed to avoid actual jail time so far, though I don't know if that streak will last much longer.\n\nJust today, I got a call that he\u2019s been picked up again for making a threat, apparently against someone he doesn\u2019t even know. It may have been online, but I don\u2019t have any details. Yes, I pay for his legal representation because I want him to have a fair chance in the system. But none of the seriousness is getting through to him.\n\nThe thing is, outside of this one huge and destructive issue, he\u2019s actually a decent person. He lives at home, has always held a steady job, doesn\u2019t do drugs, and doesn\u2019t drink much. He\u2019s had therapy and takes medication, although not always consistently. He\u2019s been diagnosed with ADHD and depression. He was in special education growing up, but the only formal diagnoses were developmental delay and ADHD.\n\nIn many ways, he\u2019s still like a child: immature, impulsive, and unable to fully grasp consequences (obviously!) But because he's an adult, I often don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on day to day until everything blows up. I try to stay out of his business unless he asks for help, but then the damage is already done.\n\nI feel helpless watching him self-destruct and worried sick that one day the legal system is going to finally lose patience. And even then, I don't think jail or more probation is going to fix what ever is broken in him.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been through anything like this, I\u2019d really appreciate hearing about your experience.

    "text": "X Post from another sub, just looking to see other people's thoughts. \n\n\nI do want to give a bit of background here first, because I think some of what I'm feeling is due to the fact that my sister-in-law (SiL) has already crossed a few boundaries with us in the past couple weeks. Heads up, this is gonna be long.\n\n\nLet me start by saying that my wife and I are fairly religious. I like to think that I'm not too big of a prude, and many of my friends have said that I'm not super judgmental of their life choices as long as they respect mine. My SiL (wife's younger sister) was raised in the same tradition, though she is atheist today (she says that she's experimenting with Wicca and uses tarot cards, crystals, and manifestation). I'm totally fine with this, to each your own, I just asked that when she's in our house she be respectful of our practices and be considerate how she discusses her beliefs vs ours in front of the kids etc.\n\n\nOne thing I will also add, over the last year or so, SiL and her husband (BiL) have decided to have an open relationship and are currently in a poly relationship with another married couple. Again, I'm not here to yuck her yum, they're all adults and can make their own choices. However, two weekends ago she came to visit with her husband the the female counterpart of their companion couple (I'll call her Stacy because it's not her name). We said that we will treat everyone respectfully, but we did ask that they avoid engaging in PDA with Stacy in front of our kids. My kids are aged 7, 5, and 2, and we would rather have those conversations with them when we feel ready to have those conversations with them and feel like they are ready to understand. Not that I want to completely shelter my kids, and I would ultimately prefer them to make their own informed choices regarding God and life, etc, but I do think that 7 and 5 is still a little young for certain conversations.\n\n\nAnyway, on Easter, when they were in town, my wife asked that they do not come over. We live in a state where recreational cannabis is legal, while they do not, so they had told us that on Easter (being 4/20) they were gonna be blazing the whole day. I don't really mind being around drink and high people generally, but my wife has had some really negative interactions with her sister while sister was high, and she doesn't like to see her in that condition. SiL agreed and said that she'll just come see us on Monday instead. Well, she ends up showing up unannounced to surprise us, but she was basically sober so w/e. Couple hours later tho, and BiL and Stacy show up (also completely unannounced) and walk right in, with his arm around Stacy's waist and they're both completely wasted. They didn't stick around long, but my wife still felt pretty betrayed. Two days later, we had all three over for dinner. They were much more respectful regarding PDA, BUT they kept calling each other babe and honey etc. throughout the meal. In both of these situations, it's like a boundary was clearly set, and while it wasn't technically crossed, it was definitely pushed.\n\n\nSo that's the background (I can definitely add more details/history if requested, but that should give you a rough idea).\n\n\nOn Christmas, SiL gave my 5 y.o. daughter a kid camera. It's a cute device that prints a little B/W copy of the pic and saves a digital copy you can download later, plus it's got a couple games. It's on Amazon for like 30 bucks. So today, my wife is driving the kids to the post office after work, and she hears in the back seat, \"[Older sister], I don't really like this boobs picture.\" My wife takes the camera, and, lo and behold, there's a selfie of SiL and Stacy, naked, boobs touching, full boob including nips clearly visible. I poke around the device's memory, and it seems that they took that and a few other photos prior to wrapping it up for Christmas. It just feels like she doesn't care. I mean, I know it was an accident, but why wouldn't you double check to delete it before giving it to a child? It all just feels so inward focused and self countered without thinking of how her actions affect others. \n\n\nAnyway, my wife was ticked. We had a long conversation with my daughter about not letting people take pictures of you naked and not letting people show you pictures of themselves naked etc. My wife wanted to call SiL right then, and I encouraged her to calm down first. Eventually, my wife sent her a text saying, hey, this happened, please be careful what you give to my kids in the future. SiL responded: \"Oh my gosh I am so sorry, I didn't realize it had digital storage!!! That is so unacceptable I'm sorry this was a really bad accident, I will make sure it doesn't happen again\" This is frankly hard to believe, as she SHOWED us the features of the camera (including the digital storage) when my daughter opened it. Either way, we're both still upset.\n\n\nI don't really know what I'm looking for posting this. It's like somewhere between a rant, an \"am I the jerk,\" and a little bit just seeking validation and vindication on my feelings and response here. I guess the biggest thing is probably just wanting an anonymous platform to air my frustration, so if nothing else, ty for listening to my rant.\n\n\nEither way, I'm curious to hear other people's thoughts and responses to this situation. Sorry it got so wordy.",

    "text": "We have been together for about 2 months now and I have had it. I am done telling banger-level jokes to this man only for him to blink at me like I just farted in Latin. I\u2019m 19. He\u2019s 24. Which means he\u2019s had FIVE extra years on this Earth to develop a sense of humor and yet somehow he managed to dodge all the jokes, memes, joy, and serotonin life had to offer. Evolution really dropped the ball with him.\n\nI could say, \u201cHey babe, what do you call cheese that isn\u2019t yours?\u201d and this man would stare at me like I just declared war on dairy. Not a chuckle. Not even a pity smirk. One time I made a perfectly timed sarcastic remark and he LITERALLY went, \u201cHuh?\u201d and checked his phone. Bro. I just delivered Oscar-worthy wit and you\u2019re scrolling\u00a0*LinkedIn*??\n\nHe\u2019ll watch a guy get hit in the nuts with a shovel on YouTube and laugh like he just heard George Carlin reincarnated, but if\u00a0*I*\u00a0make a clever pun, he looks at me like I committed a crime against comedy. I\u2019m not asking for a standing ovation \u2014 just\u00a0*react*, dude. Pretend you have a pulse.\n\nThe worst part? I\u2019m hilarious. My friends, my mother, my gay brother and his even-more-gay boyfriend seem to think I am funny. But him? I could dress up as a clown, juggle flaming chainsaws, and recite a Shakespearean roast of Elon Musk, and he\u2019d just blink twice and say, \u201cYou done?\u201d\n\nSo yeah. Maybe I should start charging this man for my daily performances. Or just date someone who thinks humor is sexy and not some evolutionary defect to be squashed out of existence.\n\nAnyway. Thanks for listening. Hope\u00a0*you*\u00a0laughed, unlike my boyfriend, whose soul was apparently forged in a humorless void.\n\n**TL;DR:**\u00a0My boyfriend never laughs at my jokes or even acknowledges them, and it's making me feel like I'm slowly dying inside while doing stand-up comedy to a ghost. I don\u2019t know if this is just a personality mismatch or if he\u2019s emotionally unavailable with a side of zero humor. Either way, it's draining.",

    "text": "So I have just lost a friend of 20 years. To explain we were at a after party of a baby shower and there had been some drinking when my friend's spouse's uncle who lives with them started to try to touch my girlfriend inappropriately my gf kept telling him no and she had to go hid in the conner for a minute so i could stop him. I told him to stop but he kept trying finally after a tense standoff and my friend's wife intervening, He left the party. The next day I told my girlfriend that I need to talk to my friend about what happened, my gf was talking to one of her friends that had already knew about what happened and her friend texted our friend circle saying she was starting drama. After this my Friend texted her and told her we are not welcome at their home along with some other nasty things and defended the uncle. It really hurts because I have known this friend my whole life and can't believe he would do this and stand up for this creep. Even if he apologized, I don't think I can forgive him nor trust him again. Part of me feels like I'm being over dramatic but I know that cutting him out of my life is the right thing to do.",

On Monday, in the early hours of the morning my father was about to go to work when he saw a drone flying over head. Then on Tuesday, some Mormon folks came by and my father told them to go away, now yesterday those same Mormon folks came by again when no one was home besides my grandmother when there was no vehicles, and she answered and since she can't speak English very well she still managed to get them to go away. Now today nothing has happened so far but my family has been on edge. Has anyone had an experience like this recently or are we just hitting random coincidences?",

    "text": "I am 20 f and my boyfriend is 19 m. We have been dating for about 5 months now and we are pretty serious. There are only a few issues that seem to be making me have doubts recently. At the beginning of our relationship he messaged his ex it wasn\u2019t anything flirty or anything like that. However he had told me previously how much he hated her because of what she had done to him. So it threw me off when i found out that he had done that. I have a difficult time trusting people due to my past (which i won\u2019t get into) so him doing that really made me a lot more aware of how he was acting and what he was doing. He hasn\u2019t done anything wrong in our relationship other than that and lying to me a couple of times. One day i went on his phone and seen 15 odd messages between him and his friend calling me controlling and manipulative? when i asked him about it he just said he was spiralling and it was because he\u2019s been hurt before and that none of it was true. I don\u2019t really know what to think? as that really hurt me but also i might be hurting him without even being aware of it. I don\u2019t want to be that type of person i really really do love him. \nIts also hard right now to bring anything up to him as he recently tried to kill himself after an argument that we had. I had to drive to the bridge and get him to get down which was really traumatic but again i don\u2019t feel like i can bring this up to him as im scared he will feel bad about it. And do it again. \n\n(i really love him i just don\u2019t know how to stop myself overthinking so much) ",

    "text": "I\u2019ve been sitting with a lot of feelings lately about being single, and I\u2019m realizing it\u2019s more complicated than just wanting a relationship. I\u2019m chronically single, and despite a lot of effort, nothing has really stuck. I do want a relationship\u2014but not just any one. I\u2019m holding out for a healthy, aligned connection. And that\u2019s where things get frustrating.\n\nIn the past, I used to feel left behind or even resentful when friends got into relationships or got married while I stayed stalled in singleness. But lately, I\u2019ve noticed a shift. I\u2019m no longer envious\u2014if anything, I find myself disturbed by the kinds of relationships many people around me are in.\n\nSome of my friends are dating or married to men I frankly dislike. In some cases, I\u2019d even call the relationships emotionally or mentally abusive. There\u2019s also this other side of things where I\u2019ve had to let go of friendships because of how relationship-centered they\u2019ve become. And I don\u2019t mean \u201cthey value their partner\u201d\u2014I mean things like:\n\n- Inviting me out under the impression it\u2019s a one-on-one hang and then their partner shows up.\n\n-Canceling plans because they got a last-minute date.\n\n-Vanishing into their relationship and only resurfacing when their partner isn\u2019t available.\n\n-going on and on about how they\u2019re really only interested in making/engaging with \u201ccouple friends\u201d now.\n\n\nI had a friend who stayed in a situationship with a man who explicitly said he didn\u2019t want to be in a monogamous relationship with her. She still acted like they were together. When he finally broke things off, she spiraled to the point that I was afraid for her safety\u2014and I stayed with her, nurtured her, tried to help. Weeks later she suddenly had a new boyfriend. I didn\u2019t find out until they were engaged (7 months later), and she told me she hadn\u2019t said anything because she thought I was \u201cjealous\u201d of her past relationships\u2014when all I did was express concern over how she was being treated. \n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing\u2014so many of the relationships I\u2019ve witnessed come with really heavy dynamics. Things left unspoken, emotional manipulation, unhealthy dependency. It\u2019s not just that I don\u2019t envy them\u2014I actively feel relieved not to be caught in some of those patterns.\n\nSo here I am: craving deep romantic connection, but also not seeing any relationship around me that I\u2019d want to trade places with. I don\u2019t envy them. I don\u2019t want to settle for emotional immaturity, abuse, or being someone\u2019s rehab center.\n\nAnd lately I\u2019ve been wondering\u2014do I even want romance, or do I just want the kind of emotional intimacy and care that our society only seems to make room for inside romantic relationships? If friendship were truly valued and emotionally rich, would I still feel this ache?",

    "text": "More than I can't tell her it's I have weighted out the options back when I first found out and I realised I was in no position to tell her.\n\nA little bit of context:\nI was friends with this girl in my childhood, we were neighbours and would spend many days playing together. She's a sweet girl who tries to appear confident and badass but deep down she has a golden heart.\n\nI moved countries over 10 years ago so I haven't been in contact with her for ages and we obviously lost our friendship.\n\nSome months ago a younger friend of mine told me that my friend's boyfriend was at one of her friend's party and he was making out with 15 year olds. \nHe also slept with a 15 year old all night and even had breakfast in the morning a few days before my friend posted a cute New Year's couple's picture.\nHe also has two phones.\n\nI weighted my options and thought about telling her but I first asked my family and my other friends for their opinion on this. I didn't want to make a rushed decision without thinking about it logically. I was going to write her anonymously. So what stopped me? \n\n1. He's highly dangerous, he's associated with this gang that has money and power in that village. On top of these connections he is also aggressive and violent with others. He's someone that wouldn't care about the consequences if you wrong him.\nI couldn't risk him finding out that my friend told me and I told his gf. I would be first of all putting my friend in danger since she lives in the same village as them.\n\n2. How do I know he would find out? All his boys know about it but nobody would snitch on him as they haven't done in all these years.\nShe has beef with one of his friends and would have a reasonable motive to tell on him.\n\n3. She might not believe me. He is a very good liar and manipulator so I'm 100% certain he'd twist this and make it seem as if someone out there is jealous and lying and that he only maybe kissed the girl because he was drunk etc.\n I would basically make them have a temporary crisis then all will be back to normal.\n\n4. Number 3 is reinforced by the fact that they were about to get marrier in two months and she might have let him slide because they had already spent money and resources into that wedding.\n\n5. I met her in the shop and made a sad and weird face when she told me she was about to get married. I don't think she got the hint since she might have just thought I was jealous. My face had clear concern on it but it wasn't even my intention to go further than that since she was accompanied by someone else.\n\nNow she's pregnant and I'm 100% sure he'll keep cheating on her and she'll end up miserable and divorced. \n\nThe whole village must know about this affair but everyone is too scared to snitch on him.\n\nIt's a pretty shitty situation and yes I do feel crap for not telling her. I wish it wasn't this complicated and I could just tell her.\n\nIt's too late now, she'll eventually find out and I can only wish her the best and to find a respectful guy that truly loves and deserves her.",
